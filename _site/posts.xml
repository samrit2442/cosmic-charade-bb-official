<p>A deadly dice game that from your perspective gives you a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?97.2%5C%25"> chance of surviving. But from your friend’s perspective, there’s a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?90%5C%25"> chance that this game kills you. How does this make sense?</p>
</div>
<section id="rules-of-the-game" class="level1">
<h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
<p>One person walks into a room and rolls a pair of dice. As long as they don’t roll double sixes, they walk out of the room alive and they win <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%5C;%5Ctext%7Bmillion%7D"> dollars. The game continues but this time <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10"> people walk into the room. and an appointed roller rolls the dice and if they don’t roll double sixes, all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10"> people walk out of the room alive and with a million bucks each. Each round the number of players in the room increases by a factor of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10">. So, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1,10,100,1000,%2010000%5Cldots"> Each participant only gets to play one round, and as soon as double sixes are rolled, the game is over forever. Also for this game, we have an unlimited supply of money and an infinity of people because we’re gonna get to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10"> billion people by the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?11%5E%7B%5Ctext%7Bth%7D%7D"> round and that’s more humans than we have on Earth. We also have a room that can hold infinite people.</p>

<h1><strong>Suspend Reality</strong></h1>
<p>When an unlucky roller finally rolls double sixes — also called “boxcars”, or “midnight” — everyone in that room dies instantly. Kind of a grim game, but a million bucks is life-altering money so you may determine that it’s worth the risk. After all, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2394262/"><strong>odds of survival</strong></a> are in your favor. Six sides on each of two dice, marked with dots officially called pips, means there are a possible <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?36"> combinations you can roll. That’s a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B36%7D"> chance you’ll roll double sixes, which is only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2.77%5C%25"> repeating which will round up to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2.8%5C%25."></p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>To put it in another way, there are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?35"> different combinations of surviving rolls and only <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> combination of death rolls. You might think that the game could be played for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?18"> rounds before there was a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?50/50"> chance of rolling double sixes because <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?18"> rolls out of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?36"> possible combinations are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?50%5C%25."></p>

<p><strong><em>Well, no that’s actually not how we figure this out.

<h1><strong>Combinatorial Probability</strong></h1>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem"><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>
<p>The easiest way to figure this out is actually to put the problem in terms of success instead of failure. So, there’s a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B35%7D%7B36%7D"> chance that our roll will let us survive. To calculate the probability of the game players all having a certain number of surviving rolls, we raise <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B35%7D%7B36%7D%5Cbigg)%5En">, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n"> is the number of rounds the game played. In <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5"> rounds, the chances that everyone survives are about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?87%5C%25%20."> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10"> rounds and that drops to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?75%5C%25."> At <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n=18"> rounds, there’s still a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?60%5C%25"> chance that no one has rolled double sixes. It isn’t until the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?25%5E%7B%5Ctext%20%7Bth%7D%7D"> round that the odds shift against us.</p>
</section>
<section id="understandably-concerned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understandably-concerned"><strong>Understandably Concerned</strong></h2>
<p>You could roll double sixes on the very first try. It’s not very likely. But each player is only playing one round, and we know that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B36%7D"> is about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2.8%5C%25."> This means, to you, the player, you have a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?97.2%5C%25"> of living and getting the money whether you’re on your own in the first round or in round <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?9"> with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?99,999,999"> other people. But when your friend hears that the game has finished and you were one of the players, he knows there’s about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?90%5C%25"> chance you’re no longer in the mortal realm and he’s understandably concerned. After all, he is your best friend. The reason he’s concerned is very simple. Despite a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2.8%5C%25"> risk of a dice-rolling fatality, there’s about a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?90%5C%25"> chance that you were one of the unfortunate, recently perished, losers. The danger is a matter of perspective. You know you have got over a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?97%5C%25"> chance of surviving your round and getting paid. Your risk of death by double sixes is low. But poor, sad your friend realizes that because of each round’s escalation of players, the final group that rolled double sixes and succumbed to the deadly rules of the game, makes up almost <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?90%5C%25"> of all those who played. So, if you participated, you were likely in that group. To your best friend, there’s only a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10%5C%25"> chance you survived.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1>
<p>Your truth is that your chance of surviving is extremely high. Your friend’s truth is that the chance of you dead is nearly <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?9"> out of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10">. In the double sixes death game, reality doesn’t change <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?-"> but a person’s perspective can flip that probability on its pips.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>One of the most remarkable aspects of the human brain is its ability to recognise patterns and describe them. Among the hardest patterns we’ve tried to understand is the concept of turbulent flow in fluid dyanamics. The German physicist Werner Heisenberg said,</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong><em>“When I meet god, I’m going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first.”</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>As difficult as turbulence is to understand mathematically, we can use art to depict the way it looks. In June 1889, <strong>Vincent van Gogh</strong> painted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room at the <strong>Saint-Paul-de-Mausole</strong> asylum in some Saint-Remy-de-Provence, where he’d admitted himself after mutilating his ear in a psychotic episode.</p>
<section id="luminance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="luminance"><strong>Luminance</strong></h2>
<p>In “The Starry Night”, his circular Brushstrokes create a night sky filled with swirling clouds and eddies of stars. Van Gogh and other impressionists represented light in a different way than their predecessors, seeming to capture its motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in starlight that twinkles and melts through milky waves of the blue night sky. The effect is caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance"><strong>luminance</strong></a><strong>,</strong> the intensity of the light in the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part of our visual cortex, which sees light contrast and motion, but not color, will blend two differently colored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains’ primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors without blending. With these two interpretations happening at once, the light in many impressionist works seems to pulse, flicker, and radiate oddly. That’s how this and other impressionist works use quickly executed prominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real about how light moves.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="turbulence"><strong>Turbulence</strong></h2>
<p>60 years later, Russian mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov"><strong>Andrey Kolmogorov</strong></a> furthered our mathematical understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B3%7D"> power or R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description of turbulence remains one of the unsolved problems in physics. A turbulent flow is self-similar if there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies transfer theirs to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of this include Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, cloud formations, and interstellar dust particles.</p>

<p>In 2004, using the <strong>Hubble Space Telescope</strong>, scientists saw the eddies of the distant cloud of dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them of Van Gogh’s <strong>“Starry Night”.</strong></p>

<section id="van-goghs-luminance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="van-goghs-luminance"><strong>Van Goghs Luminance</strong></h2>
<p>This motivated scientists from Mexico, Spain, and England to study the luminance in Van Gogh’s paintings in detail. They discovered that there is a distinct pattern of turbulent fluid structures close to Kolmogorov’s equation hidden in many of Van Gogh’s paintings. The researchers digitized the paintings and measured how the brightness varies between any two pixels. From the curves measured for pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from Van Gogh’s period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar to fluid turbulence. His self-portrait with a pipe, from a calmer period in Van Gogh’s life, showed no sign of this correspondence. And neither did other artists’ work that seemed equally turbulent at first glance, like Munch’s “<strong>The Scream.</strong>” While it’s too easy to say Van Gogh’s turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it’s also far too difficult to accurately express the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gough was somehow able to perceive and represent one of the most supremely difficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind’s eye with the deepest mysteries of movement, fluid, and light.</p>

<h1>A Review of Light</h1>
<p>Light is our primary means of perceiving the world around us. Indeed, in a scientific context, the detection of light is a very powerful tool for probing the universe around us. Light is electromagnetic radiation that shows the properties of both waves and particles. Electromagnetic radiation, as the name suggests, describes fluctuations of electric and magnetic fields, transporting energy at the Speed of Light (which is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?3%5Ctimes10%5E8%5C%20%20%5Ctext%7Bm/s%7D">). Light is a form of energy that can be detected by the human eye. Light exists in tiny energy packets called photons.</p>

<p>As light interacts with matter, it can be become altered, and by studying light that has originated or interacted with matter, many of the properties of light can be determined. Like Absorption, Reflection, Refraction, and Scattering. Scattering has been further classified into two parts. Elastic (known as Rayleigh Scattering) and In-elastic (known as Raman Scattering).&nbsp;</p>

<section id="what-is-spectroscopy" class="level1">
<h1><strong>What is Spectroscopy</strong></h1>
<p>The study of how ‘species’ (i.e., atoms, molecules, solutions) react to light. Some studies depend on how much light an atom absorbs. The electromagnetic radiation absorbed, emitted, or scattered by the molecule is analyzed. Typically, a beam of radiation from a source such as a laser is passed through a sample, and the radiation exiting the sample is measured. Some, like Raman, depend on a molecule’s vibrations in reaction to the light.&nbsp;This figure shows the Electromagnetic Spectrum, highlighting the narrow window of Visible Light that is detectable by the human eye.&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>Light Scattering Phenomenon</strong></h1>
<p>Light can be examined entirely from its source. When light passes from one medium to any other medium say air, or a glass of water then a part of the light is absorbed by particles of the medium preceded by its subsequent radiation in a particular direction. This phenomenon is termed scattering of light. The intensity of scattered light depends on the size of the particles and the wavelength of the light.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When a monochromatic radiation of frequency <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu"> is passed through a non-absorbing medium, it is found that most of it is transmitted without any change, and some of it is scattered. If the scattered energy is analyzed utilizing a spectrometer, the bulk of the energy is found at the frequency of the incident beam 𝜈 but a small portion of the scattered energy will be found at frequencies <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu=%5Cnu_%7B0%7D%5Cpm%20%5Cnu_m">. The scattering of radiation with a change of frequency is called Raman scattering.</p>

<p>In Raman spectroscopy, by varying the frequency of the radiation, a spectrum can be produced, showing the intensity of the exiting radiation for each frequency. This spectrum will show which frequencies of radiation have been absorbed by the molecule to raise it to higher vibrational energy states.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scattering of electromagnetic radiation is in two common types Rayleigh and Raman scattering. Even though there are some differences between them, the key difference between Rayleigh and Raman scattering is that Rayleigh scattering is a form of elastic scattering of light or any other electromagnetic radiation whereas Raman scattering is a form of inelastic scattering of light or any other electromagnetic radiation.&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>Principal of Raman Spectroscopy</strong></h1>
<p>Raman spectroscopy is based on Raman scattering (or Raman effect) that reveals the vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes of molecules. In this technique, the sample is exposed to an intense beam of monochromatic light (typically a laser beam) in the frequency range of the visible, near-infrared, or near-ultraviolet region. Electromagnetic radiation, interacting with a substance, can be transmitted, absorbed, or scattered. When the monochromatic radiation is scattered by molecules, the majority of the radiation undergoes the common Rayleigh scattering (radiation’s frequency/wavelength is unchanged). However, a small fraction of the scattered radiation is observed to have a slightly different frequency from that of the incident radiation. This is known as the <strong>Raman effect</strong>. The Raman lines show up pairwise. The dominant Stokes lines have a lower frequency (longer wavelength) than the initial radiation, whereas the weaker (often non-detectable) anti-stokes lines have a higher frequency (shorter wavelength). The frequency shifts are virtually independent of the excitation wavelength and are characteristic of the particular substance/molecule. Usually, one only records the relatively strong Stokes lines, which therefore are attributed to a positive frequency shift. Such spectral coordinate is called the <strong>Raman shift</strong> and is measured in wave numbers (in cm-1). See the scheme in the figure below.</p>

</ul>
<p>As with other spectroscopic techniques, Raman spectroscopy detects certain interactions of light with matter. In particular, this technique exploits the existence of Stokes and Anti-Stokes scattering to examine molecular structure. When radiation in the near-infrared (NIR) or visible range interacts with a molecule, several types of scattering can occur. Three of these can be seen in the energy diagram in the figure below.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>Three types of scattering by a molecule excited by a photon with energy, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E%20=%20h%CE%BD">. The most common transition is marked with bold arrows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all three types of scattering, an incident photon of energy hν raises the molecule from a vibrational state to one of the infinite numbers of virtual states located between the ground and first electronic states. The type of scattering observed is dependent on how the molecule relaxes after excitation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rayleigh scattering is by far the most common transition since no change has to occur in the vibrational state of the molecule. The anti-Stokes transition is the least common, as it requires the molecule to be vibrationally excited before the photon is incident upon it. Due to the lack of intensity of the anti-Stokes signal and filtering requirements that eliminate photons with incident energy and higher, generally, only Stokes scattering is used in Raman measurements. The relative intensities of Rayleigh, Stokes, and anti-Stokes scattering can be seen in the figure below.</p>

<section id="dipole-moment-in-a-molecule" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Dipole Moment In a Molecule</strong></h1>
<p>Raman scattering can be explained using molecular polarizability. If a molecule is placed in an electric field, electrons and nuclei get displaced. Due to the separation of charged species, an electric dipole moment is induced in the molecule, and it is said to be polarized. If <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E"> is the strength of the electric field and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> is the magnitude of the induced dipole moment, then&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cboxed%7B%F0%9D%91%9D%20=%20%F0%9D%9B%BC%F0%9D%90%B8%7D%C2%A0%5Chspace%7B1%20cm%7D%20...(1)%0A"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%F0%9D%9B%BC"> is the polarizability of the molecule. If a sample is subjected to an electromagnetic wave of frequency <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%CE%BD_0">, the electric field experienced by each molecule of the sample varies as</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboxed%7B%F0%9D%90%B8%20=%20%F0%9D%90%B8_0%5Ccos(2%F0%9D%9C%8B%5Cnu_0%F0%9D%91%A1)%7D%20%5Chspace%7B1%20cm%7D%20...(2)%C2%A0">where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E_0"> is the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave. Thus, we can rewrite the eq. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(1)"> as,&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboxed%7B%F0%9D%91%9D%20=%20%F0%9D%9B%BC%F0%9D%90%B8_0%5Ccos(2%F0%9D%9C%8B%5Cnu_0%F0%9D%91%A1)%7D%20%5Chspace%20%7B1%20cm%7D%20...(3)"></p>
<p>and this implies that the interaction of electromagnetic radiation of frequency <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%CE%BD_0"> induces a molecular dipole moment that oscillates and emits radiation of the same frequency, and this is the classical explanation of Rayleigh scattering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the ability to perturb the local electron cloud of a molecular structure depend on the relative location of the individual atoms; hence, the polarizability is a function of the instantaneous position of the constituent atoms. So, the polarizability changes with small displacement from the equilibrium position (i.e., molecular vibration) and is given by,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboxed%7B%20%5Calpha%20=%20%5Calpha_0%5C%20+%5C%20%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Calpha%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20r%7D%5Cbigg)%20%5CDelta%20r%7D%20%5Chspace%7B1%20cm%7D%20...(3)%0A"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%F0%9D%9B%BC"> is equilibrium polarizability and if a molecule executes simple harmonic motion, the displacement can be represented as,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cboxed%7B%5CDelta%20r=r_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D%5C%20%5Ccos(2%5Cpi%5Cnu%20t)%7D%20%5Chspace%7B1%20cm%7D...(4)"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?r_%7Bmax%7D"> is the maximum separation distance between atoms relative to their equilibrium position.</p>
<p>Therefore we can write, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha%20=%20%5Calpha_0%5C%20+%5C%20%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20%5Calpha%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20r%7D%5Cbigg)%20r_%7B%5Ctext%7Bmax%7D%7D%5C%20%5Ccos(2%5Cpi%5Cnu%20t)"></p>

<p>The first term in this equation represents <strong>Rayleigh scattering</strong> and occurs at the excitation frequency <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cnu">. The second and third terms correspond to Stokes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%F0%9D%9C%88%20-%20%5CDelta%5Cnu)"> and anti-Stokes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(%F0%9D%9C%88%20+%5CDelta%20%5Cnu)"> scattering. In both inelastic scatterings, the excitation frequency is modulated by the vibrational frequency of the bond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, from this eq., the molecules that have Raman active vibration modes must experience a change in polarizability during a vibration, i.e., the electron density in the molecule must distort from its typical shape (inducing a dipole). Molecules with symmetrical bends and stretches, therefore, are generally better Raman scatterers. So, for a molecule to be Raman active, its molecular rotation or vibration must cause a change in a component of molecular polarizability.</p>

<h1><strong>Comparison of Raman and IR Spectroscopy</strong></h1>
<p>In context A vibrational spectroscopy</p>
<ul>
<li><p>IR and Raman are the most common vibrational spectroscopies for assessing molecular motion and fingerprinting species.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Raman is based on the inelastic scattering of a monochromatic excitation source.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Raman spectroscopy sounds very much like infrared (IR) spectroscopy; however, IR examines the wavenumber at which a functional group has a vibrational mode, while Raman observes the shift in vibration from an incident source. The Raman frequency shift is identical to the IR peak frequency for a given molecule or functional group. As mentioned above, this shift is independent of the excitation wavelength, giving versatility to the design and applicability of Raman instruments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cause of the vibration is also mechanistically different between IR and Raman. This is because the two operate on different sets of selection rules. IR absorption requires a dipole moment or change in charge distribution to be associated with the vibrational mode. Only then can photons of the same energy as the vibrational state of the molecule interact. A schematic of this can be seen in the figure below.</p>

<p>Many molecules that are inactive or weak in the IR will have intense Raman signals. This results in often complementary techniques.&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="what-does-raman-spectroscopy-measure" class="level1">
<h1><strong>What does Raman Spectroscopy Measure</strong></h1>
<p>Raman activity depends on the polarizability of a bond and how easily electrons can be displaced from the bond, or conversely how tightly they are held to the nuclei. Distortion of electrons is easier as the bond becomes longer and harder when it shortens thus polarizability changes with vibration– and this vibrational mode scatters Raman light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an asymmetric stretch, the electrons are more easily polarized in the bond that expands &amp; less easily in the bond that compresses, thus there is no overall change in the polarizability of the bond in it is Raman inactive.</p>
<section id="types-of-raman-spectroscopy" class="level2">

<h1><strong>Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)</strong></h1>
<p>Now the time is to introduce Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). One of the limitations of the Raman effect is that it is a very weak phenomenon. About one in 107 photons undergo Raman scattering. Therefore, the Raman signal is very low from low concentrations of the analyte or poor Raman scatterers. Sometimes the high fluorescence from the molecule obscures the Raman signals. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is all about amplifying Raman signals from molecules, by several orders of magnitude. SERS is a technique where molecules undergo much higher scattering efficiencies when adsorbed on metal colloidal nanoparticles or rough metal surfaces.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>The group discovered an anomalously large enhancement of the Raman signal of pyridine in the presence of a roughened silver electrode. In the definition of SERS, we can say, SERS is a phenomenon associated with the enhancement of the electromagnetic field surrounding small objects optically excited near an intense and sharp plasmon resonance. The enhanced fields excite the adsorbate (probe) and the scattered radiation will again be enhanced. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) consists in using the large local field enhancements that can exist at metallic surfaces (under the right conditions, typically by profiting from localized surface plasmon resonances) to boost the Raman scattering signal of molecules at (or close to) the surface.</p>
<p>Using SERS increases in the intensity of Raman signal have been regularly observed on the order of 104-106, and can be as high as 108 and 1014 for some systems. SERS works best with coinage (Au, Ag, Cu) or alkali (Li, Na, K) metal surfaces. The importance of SERS is that the surface selectivity and sensitivity extend RS applications to a wide variety of interfacial systems previously inaccessible to RS because RS is not surface sensitive.The enhancement was initially attributed to greater than expected, or fractal-like, surface area, but subsequent reports showed that the anomalous intensity could not be accounted for by increased surface area and were, in fact, a new phenomenon, giving rise to the idea of the SERS cross-section. However, while SERS has become a large and extremely active field of study, there is still a debate on the exact details of its mechanism and its magnitude.</p>

<h1>The Problem we are interested</h1>
<p>Here’s an age-old question consider a sequence of prime numbers <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2,3,5,7,11,13,17,%20%5Cldots"> Now given a prime number of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P"> how would one predict the next prime number in the sequence?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="euclid-theorem"><strong>Euclid Theorem</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s start from the basics in middle school we learned that any number can be factored into prime numbers. For example, 30 can be written as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?30=3%20%5Ctimes2%20%5Ctimes5"> . So, we have two types of numbers primes and composite numbers. Euclid’s theorem is fairly straightforward. It states that</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong><em>“There are an infinite number of primes.”</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Let’s quickly go over a proof. This proof is actually pretty interesting. We have used proof by contradiction. We have assumed that this statement is false i.e., there are finite number of primes.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong><em>Let P be the product of every single prime number.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Let Q = P + 1</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>a) If Q is prime, then contradiction.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>b) If Q isn’t prime then one of its prime factors p</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Let’s look at one of those prime factors <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> and since <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> also divides <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P">, it should divides <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P-Q"> which is equal to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> and since no prime number divides <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">, it’s another contradiction. So it’s proved that ‘<strong>there are infinite number of prime</strong>’.</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7Bi=1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20i%20=%20%5Cdfrac%7Bn(n+1)%7D%7B2%7D%5C;%5C;%20%5Ctext%7Bis%20a%20finite%20series%7D"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7Bn=0%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%20r%5En%20=%201+r+r%5E2+r%5E3+%5Cldots+r%5En+%20%5Cldots%20%5C;%5C;%20%5Ctext%7Bis%20an%20infinite%20series%7D"></p>
<p>Now let’s talk about harmonic series which we write as, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%20=%201+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%20%5Cldots">This series was shown divergent in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?14%5E%7B%5Ctext%7Bth%7D%7D"> century. It means that it does not approach to a finite value. It just goes on to infinity. A harmonic series is a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%5Ctext%7B-series%7D"> which is a more general term. The general term of a <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%5Ctext%7B-series%7D"> is as follows,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bp%7D%7D%20=%201+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Ep%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Ep%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%5Ep%7D+%20%5Cldots%0A"></p>
<p>The p-series will always converge when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%3E1"> . So converge means it approach to a finite value. Now we’ll define something call the <strong>zeta function</strong> which is written as follows,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Czeta(s)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5Es%7D%0A"></p>
<p>Essentially, the zeta function gives the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%5Ctext%7B-series%7D"> given a value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">. But how does this have anything to do with prime numbers? that’s why we talked about Euler’s product formula. Instead of just only giving the formula, I want to discuss the idea. So, let’s just start off with this zeta function.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Czeta(s)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bn=1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5Es%7D%20=%201+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%5Es%7D+%5Cldots%20%5Chspace%7B3cm%7D%20(1)"></p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cimplies%20%5C%20%5Cdfrac%20%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D%5Czeta(s)%20=%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%20%7B1%7D%7B8%5Es%7D+%5Cldots%20%5C;%20%5C;%20%5Ctext%7B%5Bmultiplying%20both%20sides%20by%20the%20second%20term%20of%20the%20sequence%5D%7D%20%5Chspace%7B2.5cm%7D%20(2)"></p>
<p>So you can see the right side every single multiple of 2 in the denominator. So if we want to remove that from the original zeta function. So, next step we just subtract equation 2 from equation 1</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cimplies%20%5Cleft(%201-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%20%5Czeta(s)%20=%201+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B9%5Es%7D+%5Cldots%20%5Chspace%7B3cm%7D%20(3)"></p>
<p>Then we’re going to repeat same process. So we’re gonna multiply both sides by the second term of the series now which is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D"> if we do so we’ll have,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cimplies%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D%5Cleft(%201-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%5Czeta(s)%20=%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B9%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B15%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B21%5Es%7D+%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B27%5Es%7D+%5Cldots%20%5Chspace%7B3cm%7D%20(4)"></p>
<p>and we have these terms and then we subtract them from the equation 3 then we’ll have,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cimplies%20%5Cleft(1-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%20%5Cleft(1-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%5Czeta(s)%20=%201+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B11%5Es%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B11%5Es%7D+%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B13%5Es%7D+%5Cldots%5Chspace%7B3cm%7D%20(5)"></p>
<p>So, we do this process again and again you’ll see that every time we do this we are subtracting multiples of each number so the second term in our sequence is always going to prime and if we continue this process to infinity we will get something like this.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cldots%20%5Cleft(1-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B11%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%20%5Cleft(1-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%20%5Cleft(1-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%20%5Cleft(1-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%20%5Cleft(1-%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D%20%5Cright)%5Czeta(s)%20=%201%0A"></p>
<p>and if we move all the primes to the other side writing this formula we will have,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csum_%7B%5C%0An%5Cin%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%0A%7D%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5Es%7D%20=%20%5Cprod_%7Bp%5C;%20%5Ctext%7Bprime%7D%7D%20%5Cfrac%20%7B1%7D%20%7B1-p%5E%7B-s%7D%7D%20"> This is called the Euler’s product formula it gives us the first relation between zeta function and prime numbers and since this formula was discovered in 1737, modern study of prime numbers always based on the zeta function.</p>

<h1><strong>Prime Counting Function</strong></h1>
<p>The idea of the prime counting function is pretty simple. The prime counting function is the function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi(x)"> giving the number of primes less than or equal to a given number <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x">. So, a few examples are,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi(5)%20%5Cimplies%203"></p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi(10)%20%5Cimplies%204"> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cpi(20)%20%5Cimplies%208%0A"></p>
<p>Basically, the prime counting function is a step function. It means that it’s not continuous. So, lets look at the graph of the prime counting function.</p>

<p>This function was introduced by Gauss in the 18th century and another thing Gauss showed was that you could approximate the value of the prime counting function with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7B%20%5Cln(x)%7D">. This fact is called the prime number theorem. More formally,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Clim_%7Bx%20%5Cto%20%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi(x)%7D%7B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%7D%7B%5Cln(x)%7D%7D%20=%201%0A"></p>
<p>If you take a look at this graph, you can see how it closely approaches 1 as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x%5Crightarrow%20%5Cinfty"> .</p>

<p>Another result we can take from the prime number theorem i.e., the probability that a number chosen randomly from the set <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5C%7B%201,2,3,%20%5Cldots,%20x%20%5C%7D"> is roughly <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cln(x)%7D">. In terms of prime counting function the prime number theorem tells us that each average step in the prime counting function is around <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cln(x)">. However there’s actually a better function to approximate the prime counting function.</p>
<section id="logarithmic-integral-function" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logarithmic-integral-function"><strong>Logarithmic Integral Function</strong></h2>

<p>It actually turns out that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BLi%7D(x)"> is a better approximation for the prime counting function. Here you can look at all three of them graphed.</p>

<p>Since, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BLi%7D(x)"> approximate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi(x)"> then, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clim_%7Bx%20%5Cto%20%5Cinfty%7D%20%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi(x)%7D%7B%5Cdfrac%7Bx%7D%7B%5Cln(x)%7D%7D%20=%201%20"></p>
<p>This way of approximating the prime counting function by the logarithmic integral function is was discovered by Dirichlet after Gauss mailed him prime number theorem.</p>

<h1><strong>Riemann Zeta Function</strong></h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann">Bernhard Riemann</a> was a German mathematician who studied fields like mathematical analysis, differential geometry, and number theory. He was one of the first who studied what happens when you extend the domain of zeta function from a real to a complex number.</p>
<p>Riemann zeta function is essentially the zeta function that we have discussed earlier except we extend the domain to the whole complex plane and it converges for real component which is greater than 1.</p>
<section id="why-this-is-true" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-is-true"><strong>Why This is True</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s look at some input,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Czeta%5Cbigg(a+bi%5Cbigg)%20=%201+%20%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbigg)%5E%7Ba+bi%7D+%5Cldots%20">Let’s focus on the first term and split it like this way <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbigg)%5E%7Ba+bi%7D%20=%20%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbigg)%5Ea%20%5Ccdot%20%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbigg)%5E%7Bbi%7D"> . But what does it mean to take a complex exponent and what this turns out is that a complex exponential accounts for some rotation along the unit circle with no change in the magnitude.</p>
<p>What this means for us is that the magnitude of each term in the Riemann zeta function only depends on real component and so the Riemann zeta function converges for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BRe%7D(z)%3E1"> . What about the other side of Riemann zeta function where real component is less than or equal to 1. So, Riemann used something called analytic continuation, basically he extended the domain of the zeta function by quote — unquote flipping it across. Riemann studied was the zeroes of the zeta function. To examine this let’s look at the formula of this Riemann zeta function with analytic continuation.<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Czeta(s)%20=%202%5Es%5Cpi%5E%7Bs-1%7D%5Csin%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cpi%20s%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbigg)%5CGamma(1-s)%5Czeta(1-s)%5C%5C%0A%5Czeta(s)%20=%200%5C;%5C;%20%5Ctext%7Bwhen%7D%5C;%20%5Ctext%7BRe%7D(s)%20=%20-2n%0A"></p>
<p>The term <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CGamma(1-s)"> simply derive from the concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">gamma function</a>. Basically, the gamma function is to provide a continuous function that goes through a factorial point. Here, the sine term should equal to zero for all negative even integers. These zeros are called is trivial zeros for positive even integers the gamma function forms something called a pole which cancels out 0 of the sine function. A nice illustration of the trivial zeros of this Riemann zeta function would be real components of both the input and output. Look how <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Czeta(s)%20=%200"> at negative real numbers.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>So, going back to the Euler product formula if the real component of the function is greater than 1 one of the products have to be equal zero for zeta to be equal to zero and this is impossible because of Euclid’s theorem which states that there are an infinite number of primes so the right component can not be equal to zero. That means the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have have to have real component between 0 and 1. Let’s try to visualize them. The problem being that complex functions are like pretty hard to visualize. But this is our best we have showcase below.</p>

<p>We have fixed real component of input we’ve x-axis be the imaginary component. We have the graphs <strong>value of zeta vs imaginary part of zeta with real part 0.5.</strong> Notice that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctext%7BRe%7D(s)%20=%200.5"> the real component intersect with the imaginary component at 0. This case lead us to a new concept which is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function">Riemann hypothesis</a>. It states that all the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real component <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D"> or 0.5. Here this a spiral visualization of Riemann hypothesis which is given below.</p>

<p>You’re wondering how all of this has any connection to the prime numbers. So, for this topic if we go back to the prime numbers theorem and recall how we could approximate the value of the prime counting function <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi(x)"> using the logarithmic integral function. The Riemann hypothesis helps us to talk about the error by which the logarithmic integral function can approximate this <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cpi(x)"> function. If the Riemann hypothesis is true this error is no more than some function of order <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csqrt%7Bx%7D%5C%20%5Cln(x)"> and this goes both ways if you can prove that the error is a function of order <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csqrt%7Bx%7D%5C%20%5Cln(x)"> the Riemann hypothesis is true.</p>

<p>So, this would be where we discuss about <strong>Riemann explicit formula</strong>. Riemann explicit formula gives us a direct formula for the prime counting function and the second term over here i.e., <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Csum_%5Crho%20%5Ctext%7Bli%7D(x%5E%5Crho)"> is a sum of all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann-zeta function.

</div>
<p>Here the graph is about Riemann’s explicit formula using the first 200 non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. And you can see how the graph becomes better and better approximation. Using non trivial zeros of the Riemann-zeta function you can approximate prime counting function to have a pretty high accuracy.</p>

<p>“Gravitational lensing by a neutron star is so strong that a neutron can see its own back!” — Let’s peep through a natural, gigantic magnifying glass.</p>
</div>
<p>The discovery of Gravitational Lensing has been revolutionary for the field of Science. First up—What is it exactly?</p>
<p>Gravitational lensing occurs when a huge amount of matter, like a cluster of galaxies, creates a gravitational field that distorts and magnifies the light from distant galaxies that are behind it but in the same line of sight. The effect is like looking through a giant magnifying glass.</p>
<p>The first gravitational lens was discovered in 1979, when two&nbsp;quasars were discovered very close to each other in the sky and with similar distances and spectra. The two quasars were actually the same object whose light had been split into two paths by the gravitational influence of an intervening galaxy.</p>
<p>Smaller objects, like individual stars, can also act as gravitational lenses when they pass in front of more distant stars. For a few days or weeks, light from the more distant star temporarily appears brighter because it is magnified by the gravity of the closer object, a phenomenon known as gravitational microlensing.</p>
<p>The significance of Gravitational Lensing&nbsp;is that it probes the distribution of matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and enables observations of the distant universe. Strong gravitational lensing allows us to improve the angular resolution of current and future telescopes and eliminates the need for absolute astrometry. Gravitational lenses induce time delays and produce multiple images of sources.</p>
<p>Gravitational lensing not only distorts the image of a background galaxy, it can amplify its light. For example, looking through a lensing galaxy cluster, The Hubble Space Telescope can see fainter and more distant galaxies than otherwise possible.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">The bright star in the centre of the image is the nearby white dwarf Stein 2051B, only 17 light-years from Earth. The smaller star below is about 5000 light-years away. Astronomers observed Stein 2051B eight times within two years while the white dwarf travelled in front of the distant background star. During the close alignment, the white dwarf’s gravity bent the light from the distant star, making it appear offset by about 2 milliarcseconds from its actual position. This deviation is so small that it is equivalent to observing an ant crawl across the surface of a 1€ coin from 2300 kilometers away</figcaption>

<li><strong>Multiply-imaged quasars:</strong> In 1979, the double quasar ‘<strong>Q0957+561</strong>’ was discovered through Gravitational Lensing. Initially, it was unclear whether there were two quasars really present or whether it was simply an optical illusion. But intensive observations soon confirmed the almost identical spectra. The intervening “lensing” galaxy was found, and the “supporting” cluster was identified as well. Later very similar light curves of the two images confirmed this system beyond any doubt as a bonafide gravitational lens.</li>

<li><strong>Einstein rings:</strong> The simplest type of gravitational lensing occurs when there is a single concentration of matter at the center, such as the dense core of a galaxy. The light of a distant galaxy is redirected around this core, often producing multiple images of the background galaxy. When the lensing approaches perfect symmetry, a complete or almost-complete circle of light is produced, called an Einstein ring. Hubble observations have helped to greatly increase the number of Einstein rings known to astronomers.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dark Matter:</strong> The lensed images also act as probes of the matter distribution in the galaxy cluster. The results indicate that most of the matter in a galaxy cluster is not in the visible galaxies or hot gas around them and does not emit light, and is thus called dark matter. The distribution of lensed images reflects the distribution of all matter, both visible and dark. Hubble’s images of gravitational lensing have been used to create maps of dark matter in galaxy clusters.</li>

<p>Einstein worked out the equations for his general theory of relativity and realized that massive objects caused a distortion in space-time.</p>
<p>Imagine setting a large object in the center of a trampoline. The object would press down into the fabric, causing it to dimple. If you then attempt to roll a marble around the edge of the trampoline, the marble would spiral inward toward the body, pulled in much the same way that the gravity of a planet pulls at rocks in space.</p>
<p>According to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, time and space are fused together in a quantity known as spacetime. Within this theory, massive objects cause spacetime to curve, and gravity is simply the curvature of spacetime. Light bends around a massive object, such as a black hole, causing it to act as a lens for the things that lie behind it.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it just acts like classical geometric optics. Curved spacetime causes light bundles to deflect, and also to shear and expand. The result is that a background light source can have its apparent position, shape, and flux changed by a foreground gravitational lens.</p>
<p>The surface brightness of a lensed object, however, is not changed, because the light goes from flat spacetime to flat spacetime after going through the lens, and the surface brightness is altered only by red shifts.</p>

<p>“Earth is a small town with many neighbourhoods in a very big universe” — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_J._Garan_Jr.">Ron Garan</a>.</p>
<p>As the stars move across the sky each night people from the earth have looked up and wondered about their place in the universe. The night sky and astronomical bodies have been a source of wonder and speculation since the development of the earliest civilizations. Astronomy takes us on a journey of discovery, from a detailed study of our solar system to the far distant galaxies and outermost reaches of the universe.</p>
<section id="what-is-astronomy" class="level1">
<h1>What is Astronomy?</h1>
<p>The term astronomy comes from 2 Greek words; astron - ‘<strong>star</strong>,’ and ‘<strong>nemein</strong>’ — ’to name. However, astronomy is not just study of the stars; rather it is the study of celestial phenomena. Astronomy is one of the oldest scientific disciplines striving to understand the nature of the universe and humankind’s place in it.</p>

<section id="mesopotamia" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</h2>
<p>The origins of Western astronomy can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, the “land between the rivers” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris">Tigris</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, where the ancient kingdoms of Sumer, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria">Assyria</a>, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia">Babylonia</a> were located. Pre Mesopotamian civilizations had usually linked the celestial objects to the spirits, but record still exist which shows that, as early as 3000 B.C., the Babylonian recorded some constellations and mapped the recurrent of astronomical events.</p>
<p>One of the oldest astronomical documents is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_tablet_of_Ammisaduqa">Venus tablet</a>. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammi-Saduqa">Ammisaduqa</a>, the fourth ruler after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi">Hammurabi</a> (the sixth Amorite king of the old Babylonian Empire). The tablet gives the rise times of Venus and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset in the form of lunar dates. These positions are given for a period of 21 years.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chinese-astronomy">Chinese Astronomy</h2>
<p>Chinese astronomers correctly calculated the eclipse cycle. Chinese civilization was the first civilization to have determined that there are 365 days in a year, by calculating the movement of the star against the background stars. The Chinese used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar#:~:text=A%20lunisolar%20calendar%20is%20a,Sun%20in%20the%20Earth's%20sky.">Lunisolar calendar</a> (which identifies years, months, dates according to astronomical phenomena).</p>
<p>According to Chinese mythology, an eclipse occurred when a dragon was eating the sun and that only way to defeat the dragon was to make as much as noise possible. In the event of an eclipse, people would make a mighty racket, which would scare the dragon off, and naturally, the sun would return.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="indian-astronomy">Indian Astronomy</h2>
<p>Indian astronomy has a long history. Some of the earliest roots of Indian astronomy can be dated to the period of Indus Valley civilization or earlier. Ancient Indian astronomy may be classified into two main categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Vedic Astronomy</p></li>
<li><p>The post Vedic Astronomy</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas">vedic</a> astronomy is the astronomy of the vedic period i.e.&nbsp;the astronomy found in the vedic <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samhita"><em>Saṃhitas</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmana"><em>Brahmans</em></a> and allied literature. The principal avocation of the people in the vedic times being the performance of the vedic sacrifices at the times prescribed by the śastras, it was necessary to have accurate knowledge of the science of time so that the times prescribed for performing the various vedic sacrifices could be correctly predicted well in advance. Astronomy in those times, therefore, was essentially the science of time-determination. It centred round the Sun and Moon and its aim was to study the natural divisions of time caused by the motion of the Sun and Moon, such as days, months, seasons and years, special attention being paid to the study of the times of occurrence of new moons, full moons, equinoxes and solstices.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda">Rigveda</a> shows that the Indians divided the year into 360 days, and the year was subdivided into 12 months of 30 days. Every 5 years, two intercalary periods were added to bring the calendar back in line with the solar year, ensuring that years averaged 366 days. However, the Indian year still migrated four days in every five years, and Indian astronomers constantly tweaked and adjusted their calendars over the millennia. The text also shows that the Indians used four cardinal points for ensuring the correct orientation of altars.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanga_Jyotisha">Jyotisa Vedanga</a>, the first Vedic text to mention astronomical data, records events going back as far as 4000 BCE, although many <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeoastronomy">archaeoastronomers</a> believe that this text may include observations from as early as 11,000 BCE. They point out that some of the records may have been copied from earlier manuscripts, but this is an area where more research is needed, as many of the references are unclear and couched in religious terminology.</p>
<p>The first proper astronomy began in the 5th century. Indian astronomer <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a> began to adopt a more rigorous, mathematical approach to astronomy. Aryabhata added to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism">heliocentric theory</a>, proposing the idea that the moon reflects the light of the sun, a theory also proposed by some Greeks but not widely adopted. His book, the ‘<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhatiya"><strong><em>Aryabhatiya</em></strong></a>,’ was translated into Latin in the 13th Century. This work gave the Europeans some methods for measuring the volume of spheres and the area of triangles, as well as methods for calculating square roots and cube roots. He also calculated the length of a sidereal day (23 hours , 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds). Aryabhata is known as father of ancient Indian astronomy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bhaskara-II">Bhaskara-II</a> from 12th century worked on both mathematics and astronomy . He had done a vast research on sun, moon, stars and other planets. He wrote a scripture named “<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddh%C4%81nta_Shiromani"><strong>Siddhanta Siromani</strong></a>”. There he discussed about math and astronomy.</p>

<section id="pythagoras-globe-and-eratosthenes-calculation-of-circumference-of-earth" class="level1">
<h1>Pythagoras’ Globe and Eratosthene’s Calculation of Circumference of Earth</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander">Anaximander</a> was first who suggest that the earth floats like a globe in free space. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a> was the first to assert that Earth was a globe rather than a cylinder as had been widely believed beforehand. He noticed that during a lunar eclipse the shadow of the earth on the moon. Also, he observed that the stars appear differently depending on the observer’s location.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a>, a greek mathematician successfully calculated the circumference of the Earth. Eratosthense heard of a place called Syene, where the sun shone directly down a well at noon on the summer solistice. This is due to its location almost on the Tropic of cancer, that’s why the sun would be perfectly overhead. He measured an angle of a stick perpendicular to the ground cast a shadow that was 7.12 degrees from perpendicular. That means, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria">Alexandria</a> is 7.12 degree away from Syene. Which means, if two sticks ( one at Alexandria and another one at Syene) are extended to the centre of the earth they will intersect each other by 7.12 degree angle. So, 7.12 degree is almost 1/50 th time of a full circle (360 degree). Now all he had to do was find the distance from Syene to Alexandria and multiply it by 50 to get the earth’s circumference. The distance figure he used was 805 kilometers and he multiplied it with 50, that means, 40,096 kilometers. Earth circumference is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?40,075.017"> km, which is almost near to the Eratosthenes’ calculation.</p>

<p>Although there are errors in Eratosthenes’ measurement, but it was certainly impressive for almost 2000 years ago.</p>

<h1>Ptolemy and Asristotle’s Cosmic Legacy</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> came to represent a mathematical tradition, one focused on developing mathematical models with predictive power. Ptolemy was also interested in deploying his model of the heavens to describe its physical reality. However, his most important work was the mathematical models and data he used for predicting the motion of heavenly bodies. For a long time, his name was synonymous with the model of the heavens. His scripture named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest">Almagest</a>, is a 2nd century Greek language mathematical and astronomical scripture. here, he discussed about <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/geocentric-model">geocentric model</a> of our universe which was accepted for more than 2000 years. Aristotle came to be known for putting forward the physical model of the heavens.</p>

<h1>Galileo Galilei</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> was an Italian astronomer, Physicist and Engineer. The huge turning point of astronomy was the telescope. It was invented by Galileo Galilei. He discovered the moons of the Jupiter. One of his great work was to observe <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/482/galileos-phases-of-venus-and-other-planets/#:~:text=Galileo%20Galilei's%20observations%20that%20Venus,and%20planets%20revolved%20around%20Earth.">the phases of Venus</a>. He observed that Venus exhibits a full set of phases similar to that of the Moon.</p>

<section id="celestial-alignment" class="level1">
<h1>Celestial Alignment</h1>
<p>Archaeologists who specialize in investigating astronomical ruins are called archeo-astronomers. They discovered many celestial alignment. E.g. in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_architecture">Neolithic structure</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, found in Wiltshire England the stone pillars are arranged so as to trace the position of the sun and the moon during solistices. Others argue that stonhenge is not meant to be celestially aligned and if this is the case then it is just a coincidence. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza">The great pyramid of the Giza</a> seems to be aligned with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion%27s_Belt">Orion’s belt</a>, so as to guide the death of Pharaoh to the stars of the belt, which were associated with the god of death, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Osiris-Egyptian-god">Osiris</a>.</p>

<p>History of astronomy is a really long story. Our ancestors made many scripture, sculpture to unveil the mystery of our universe. As we know we are a part of this universe, so we must know about our origin. Astronomy is the one of the main doorway to know the mystery of our origin.</p>

<p>Human endeavor has always tried to minimize this awe and bring the starry heavens near and closer. Staring at the night sky, not only increases the admiration but also an unquenchable thirst to reach out to the unknown, soars every moment as the far distance beckons.</p>

<section id="childhood-and-education" class="level1">
<h1>Childhood and Education</h1>
<p>Born on January 15, 1944, Jerry Earl Nelson’s father was a machinist working at Lockheed. Jerry, from an early age, developed a knack for astronomy, and under the savant tutelage of George Abell, he started studying astronomy.</p>
<p>Earning his B.S. in physics from the celebrated <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">California Institute of Technology</a>, he went forward to acquire his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in the year 1972.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best use of the phrase: “Necessity is the mother of invention” could not have been used in such an appropriate manner. While working at <a href="https://www.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, he was given the task to design a 10-meter telescope, which was twice the diameter of the telescope available during that time. Developing such a long telescope challenged his brilliant mind of Nelson. He came up with a solution, which revolutionized telescope technology. A segmented telescope was the answer to the problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="segmented-mirror-a-brief-history" class="level1">
<h1>Segmented Mirror: A Brief History</h1>
<p>In order to install a non-segmented, monolithic mirror, there is a limitation of constructing bigger than 8 meters in diameter.</p>
<p>A segmented telescope comprises many smaller mirrors which collectively assemble and focus light. In comparison to a single mirror, which is enormous in size, these sliced mirrors help in supporting the installation structure much easier.</p>
<p>Italian astronomer, <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/horn-darturo-guido">Guido Horn d’Arturo</a>, pioneered this idea and first built the segmented mirror in 1952. Called a “tessellated telescope”, Horn thought that assembling small bits of a mirror would be less expensive than a big one, as Italy was still crumbling under the Great depression. In 1935 and in 1952, Horn created telescopes using 17,000 photographic plates and the prototype of a 1.8 m telescope was put on display at <a href="https://sma.unibo.it/it/il-sistema-museale/museo-della-specola">Museo Della Specola di Bologna</a>.</p>

<p>Back in 1900, <a href="https://www.mtwilson.edu/">Mount Wilson</a>, California was the home of a 100-inch telescope, which was then considered to be the largest telescope in the world. American astronomer, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Ellery-Hale">George Ellery Hale</a> was already busy counting his card, to build even a larger telescope.</p>

<p>In 1960, as the need for observations in astronomy became predominant, further plans were made for better telescopes. In general, there are two types of telescopes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The reflector telescope and</p></li>
<li><p>The refractor telescope.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to get a better vision of deep sky objects, which includes galaxies and nebulas, the first one is best suited. Whereas, for viewing our solar system and moon the second one is preferable.</p>
<p>As a result, research was carried out to build large reflectors. The design of an array of telescopes and of segmented mirrors started and single mirrors were cast within a diameter of 8 m.</p>
<p>Mount Hopkins, Arizona was the first to implement MMT which is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMT_Observatory">Multiple-Mirror Telescope</a>, that used the concept of an array. The diameter was around 72 inches.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.keckobservatory.org/">W.M. Keck Observatory</a> used the segmented mirror approach, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby%E2%80%93Eberly_Telescope">Hobb-Eberly Telescope</a> also used this segmented mirror technology but only for spectroscopy. Named after Bill Hobby and Robert E. Eberly, this is one of the largest optical telescopes in the world.</p>

<section id="the-midas-touch" class="level1">
<h1>The Midas Touch</h1>
<p>Pondering over the problem, Jerry finally came up with the solution of designing 36 hexagonal mirror segments, which finally gave birth to the 10-meter Keck telescopes. Keck 1 and Keck 2 are now the world’s third and fourth largest telescopes.</p>
<p>Although segmentation solved the problem of structuring, it gave rise to another which is called alignment. With his Midas touch, Jerry designed and engineered 168 electronic sensors which were mounted on the segmental area, and a motor, which constantly kept the mirror in the correct alignment.</p>

<p>Nelson’s major contribution lies in developing AO (Adaptive Optics) which makes the image brighter and clearer by correcting the blur effect which occurs due to Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=cemax">Claire Max</a>, director of UC Observatories commented:</p>
<p>“<em>Jerry’s impacts on the field of astronomy and astrophysics are legendary, and we will all benefit from his legacy for many years to come. He was a wonderful colleague and mentor to many of us.</em>”</p>
<p>The idea that he conceived in 1977, on which W.M. Keck Observatory’s twin telescopes were built was using a dozen of segmented mirrors rather than a single one. You will be surprised to know that the technology JWST is using is also based on segmented mirror technology.</p>

<h1>JWST and Dr.&nbsp;Nelson’s Technique</h1>
<p>The recent high-resolution images, delivered by the <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/">James Webb Space Telescope</a> which created an uproar in the world of astronomy also use this segmented mirror technology. The primary mirror of Webb is determined to be 6.5 meters long. Only then it would serve the purpose of taking photographs of deep space. The team faced the problem of building a mirror this large which can be launched into space and also be able to orbit.</p>
<p>The technique invented by Dr.&nbsp;Jerry Nelson of the segmented mirror was again re-used by the Webb team, and this time they used beryllium, a chemical element that has a low density.</p>
<p>The team developed 18 hexagonal-shaped mirror segments that are 1.32 meters in diameter. This enabled the team to make the size of the mirror much larger yet lighter than that of the Hubble.</p>

<p>‘Jerry and Terry’ were always together. They were forever good friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/08/mast-in-memoriam.html">Dr.&nbsp;Terry Mast</a> from the University of California and Dr.Jerry pioneered the technology for building the ground telescope of W.M. Keck Observatory.</p>
<p>Working together, among Terry’s several papers in physics and astrophysics one was entitled “<strong><em>Figure Control for a Segmented Telescope Mirror</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>The original paper is available <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6194407">here</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, Dr.&nbsp;Jerry received the <a href="https://www.kavliprize.org/">Kavli Prize</a> in Astrophysics for his remarkable contribution in developing telescopes.</p>
<p>On his achievement the Kavli Prize mentions:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 22px">
<p><em>“He devised a way to grind the tiles into the unusual asymmetric shapes needed and a system of sensors, actuators, and computer control to make the tiles act as a single reflecting surface. It was a risky proposal and university authorities were initially skeptical, but Nelson’s design eventually led to the twin Keck Telescopes on the summit of Mauna Kea, Hawaii, each with a 10-meter mirror made from 36 segments.”</em></p>

<h1>A Vision Unfinished</h1>
<p>Suffering from a stroke attack, Dr.&nbsp;Nelson with his indomitable spirit continued working on his vision to build <a href="https://www.tmt.org/">Thirty Meter Telescopes</a>. This is considered to be an extremely large telescope that is still under construction. Also known as TMT, this would allow us to observe objects in deeper space with unparalleled details. As claimed by the scientists, once TMT is built, it would provide four times sharper images than what JWST is rendering.</p>

<p><strong>“The next time you complain that there is nothing on, remember that you can always watch the birth of the universe.”</strong></p>
<p>— Bill Bryson</p>
</div>
<p>For thousands of years, human being has been contemplating the Universe and seeking to determine its true extent. And whereas ancient philosophers believed that the world consisted of a disk, a ziggurat or a cube surrounded by celestial oceans or some kind of ether, the development of modern astronomy opened their eyes to new frontiers. By the 20th century, scientists began to understand just how vast the Universe really is!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Until the 1960s, most scientists believe that the <strong>Steady State Theory</strong>: “A theory in which the universe is assumed to have properties that are constant in space and time, so that new matter must be continuously and spontaneously created to maintain average densities as the universe expands.”</p></li>
<li><p>This was the idea that galaxies were being pushed apart by matter leaking into the universe through holes.</p></li>

</div>
<p>Let’s can understand this in a simple way, (i) the universe is eternal and essentially unchanging. (ii) Galaxies we observe moving away from each other have new ones that develop between them fill the space they leave. (iii) The resulting universe is in a “<em>steady state</em>” in the same manner that a flowing river is — the individual water molecules are moving away but the overall river remains the same.</p>

<h1>Background of CMB Discovery</h1>
<p>And in the course of looking farther out into space, and deeper back in time, cosmologists have discovered some truly amazing things. For example, during the 1960s, astronomers became aware of microwave background radiation that was detectable in all directions. Known as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the existence of this radiation has helped to inform our understanding of how the Universe began.</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:47%;">
<p>The CMB is central to the <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/54756/what-is-the-big-bang-theory/">Big Bang Theory</a> and modern cosmological models (such as the <a href="http://www.cosmotography.com/images/galaxy_formation_and_evolution.html">Lambda-CDM</a> model). As the theory goes, when the Universe was born 13.8 billion years ago, all matter was condensed onto a single point of infinite density and extreme heat. Due to the extreme heat and density of matter, the state of the Universe was highly unstable. Suddenly, this point began expanding, and the Universe as we know it began.</p>

<p>Here, in this diagram, we can see, the cosmic microwave background radiation’s “surface of last scatter” is analogous to the light coming through the clouds to our eye on a cloudy day.</p>

<section id="what-is-cmb" class="level1">
<h1>What is CMB?</h1>
<p>Looking out into deep space, and therefore back into deep time, astronomers see the CMB radiation saturating space beginning at about 3,80,000 years after Big-Bang. Before the creation of the CMB, the universe was a hot, dense and opaque plasma containing both matter and energy. Photons could not travel freely, so no light escape from those earlier times. And this time period known as the ‘<strong>Dark Age</strong>’.</p>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:47%;">
<p>The CMB was created at a time in cosmic history called <strong>Recombination Era</strong>. The universe had cooled to a temperature of about 5K degrees Fahrenheit (or, 2.7K degree Celsius), cool enough for electrons and protons to “recombine” into hydrogen atoms. Photons were released, and today this radiation is called <strong>C</strong>osmic <strong>M</strong>icrowave <strong>B</strong>ackground (CMB)</p>

<p>The CMB is essentially electromagnetic radiation that is left over from the earliest cosmological epoch which permeates the entire Universe. It is believed to have formed about 3,80,000 years after the Big Bang and contains subtle indications of how the first stars and galaxies formed. While this radiation is invisible using optical telescopes, radio telescopes are able to detect the faint signal that is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum.</p>
<p>The CMB is visible at a distance of 13.8 billion light years in all directions from Earth, leading scientists to determine that this is the true age of the Universe. However, it is not an indication of the true extent of the Universe. Given that space has been in a state of expansion ever since the early Universe (and is expanding faster than the speed of light), the CMB is merely the farthest back in time we are capable of seeing.</p>

<h1>Pigeon’s Role to Discover the CMB</h1>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:47%;">
<p>The CMB was first found by an accident. In 1965, two researchers with Bell Telephone Laboratories (Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson) were creating a radio receiver, and were puzzled by the mysterious noise of unknown origin, it was picking up. At first, the noise was thought to be interference caused by pigeon droppings on the antenna equipment. Pigeons were trapped and dung was cleaned from the antenna.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ultimately, Penzias and Wilson realized that the noise was an actual signal. They soon realized the noise came uniformly from all over the sky. At the same time, a team at Princeton University (led by Robert Dicke) was trying to find the CMB. Dicke’s team got wind of the Bell experiment and realized the CMB had been found. Later, Penzias and Wilson both received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1978.</p>

<h1>Proof of the Big-Bang</h1>
<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:47%;">
<p>By the mid-20th century, there were two competing theories for the origin of the universe. The Steady State theory and The Big-Bang theory. The Big Bang theory stated that the expanding universe must have been denser in the past, and therefore at the very beginning must have been a point of infinite density.</p>

<p>Penzias and Wilson theorized that if the Big Bang theory was correct, the universe would be filled with background radiation left over from the creation event.</p>

<div class="columns">
<div class="column" style="width:47%;">
<p>In this all-sky image of the CMB radiation, tiny differences in temperature are exaggerated. The curve line is the border between the northern and southern hemispheres of the sky. Overall, the data confirm that the standard Big-Bang theory is correct, but there are still some anomalies.</p>

</div>
<p>The southern hemisphere appears redder, therefore slightly warmer, than the northern hemisphere. The circled area is a “cold spot” in the southern hemisphere appears larger than was expected. The standard model of the Big Bang theory predicts that the CMB radiation should look mostly the same in every direction.</p>
<p>The CMB also provides insight into the composition of the universe as a whole. Most of the universe is made up of dark energy, the mysterious force that drives the accelerating expansion of the universe. The next largest ingredient is dark matter, which only interacts with the rest of the universe through its gravity.</p>
<p>Normal matter, including all the visible stars, planets and galaxies, makes up less than 5% of the total mass of the universe.</p>
</section>
<section id="history-of-cmb" class="level1">
<h1>History of CMB</h1>
<p>The existence of the CMB was first theorized by Ukrainian-American physicist George Gamow, along with his students, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, in 1948. This theory was based on their studies of the consequences of nucleosynthesis of light elements (like, hydrogen, helium and lithium) during the very early Universe. Essentially, they realized that in order to synthesize the nuclei of these elements, the early Universe needed to be extremely hot.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, ground-based instruments placed increasingly stringent limits on the temperature differences of the CMB. These included the Soviet <a href="https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/relikt/">RELIKT-1</a> mission aboard the Prognoz 9 satellite and the NASA <a href="https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/">Cosmic Background Explorer</a> (COBE) mission. Fortheir work, the COBE team received the Nobel Prize in physics in 2006.</p>

<p>COBE also detected the CMB’s first acoustic peak, acoustical oscillations in the plasma which corresponds to large-scale density variations in the early universe created by gravitational instabilities. Many experiments followed over the next decade, which consisted of ground and balloon-based experiments whose purpose was to provide more accurate measurements of the first acoustic peak.</p>

<p><strong>Sometimes you will never know the true value of moment until it becomes memory. So, let’s explore the idea of the moment in terms of mathematics and relate this to reality.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>People, who belong to mathematics, statistics, and physics background, are familiar with the term <strong>moments</strong> but do you ever realize what is moment?</p>
<p>I was doubtful about my thoughts when I just completed my higher secondary studies and was admitted to the Statistics (Hons.) program as an undergraduate student. Professors often talked about the term <strong>moment</strong>. I was confused about what the term reveal actually. Is there any relation with the term moment which is discussed in Physics?</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to express my concept and idea about moments using statistical sense as well as the concept of physics. And the end of this article I will try to relate that idea to the moment.</p>
<section id="statistical-notations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-notations"><strong>Statistical Notations:</strong></h2>
<section id="defining-expectation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="defining-expectation"><strong>Defining Expectation</strong></h3>
<p>Many frequently used random variables can be both characterized and dealt with effectively for the practical purpose by consideration of quantities called their <strong><em>expectation.</em></strong> For example, a gambler might be interested in his average winnings at a game, a businessman in his average profit on a product, a physicist in the average charge of a particle, and so on.</p>
<p>The ‘average’ value of a random phenomenon is termed its mathematical expectation or expected value. There are several senses in which the word “average” is used, but by far the most commonly used is the mean of an r.v., also known as its expected value. In addition, much of statistics is about understanding variability in the world, so it is often important to know how “spread out” the distribution is.</p>
</section>
<section id="mathematical-notation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mathematical-notation"><strong>Mathematical Notation:</strong></h3>
<p>Given a list of numbers <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1,%20x_2,%20x_3,%20%5Cldots,%20x_n">, the familiar way to average them is to add them up and divide them by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">. This is called the Arithmetic Mean and is defined by</p>
<p><span id="eq-1"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cbar%7Bx%7D%20=%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5E%7Bn%7Dx_j%0A%5Ctag%7B1%7D"></span></p>
<p>More generally, we can define a weighted mean of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1,%20x_2,%20%5Cldots,%20x_n"> as,</p>
<p><span id="eq-2"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Ctext%7BWeighted%20Mean%7D%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5En%20x_j%20p_j%0A%5Ctag%7B2%7D"></span></p>
<p>where the weights <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_1,%20p_2,%20%5Cldots,%20p_n"> are pre-specified non-negative numbers that add up to 1 (so the unweighted mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%7Bx%7D"> is obtained when <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_j%20=%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D"> for all <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.</p>
<p>The definition of a discrete Random Variable is inspired by the weighted mean of a list of numbers, with weights given by probabilities.</p>
<p><strong><em>Expectation of a discrete R.V.</em></strong> — The expected value (also called the expectation or mean) of a discrete random variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">, whose distinct possible realized values are <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1,%20x_2,%20%5Cldots"> is defined by</p>
<p><span id="eq-3"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AE(X)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%20x_j%20%5C;%20P(X%20=%20x_j)%0A%5Ctag%7B3%7D"></span></p>
<p>If the support is finite, then this is replaced by a finite sum. We can also write,</p>
<p><span id="eq-4"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AE(X)%20=%20%5Csum_%7Bx%7D%20%5Cunderbrace%7Bx%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7Bvalue%7D%7D%20%5C;%20%5Cunderbrace%7BP(X=x)%7D_%7B%5Ctext%7BPMF%20at%20%7Dx%7D%0A%5Ctag%7B4%7D"></span></p>
<p>where the sum is over the support of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> (in any case, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?xP(X=x)"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> for any <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> not in support). The expectation is undefined if <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5Csum_%7Bj=1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D%20%7Cx_j%7C%20%5C;%20P(X=x_j)%20=%20%5Cinfty"> , since the series for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E(X)"> diverges or its value depends on the order in which the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_j"> are listed.</p>
<p>In words, the expected value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is a weighted average of the possible values that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> can take on, weighted by their probabilities. Let’s check that the definition makes sense using a simple example below.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%20%5Csim%20%5Ctext%7BBern%7D(p)"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%20=%201-q"> then <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E(X)%20=%201%5Ctimes%20p%20+%200%20%5Ctimes%20q%20=%20p">,</p>
<p>which makes sense intuitively since it is between the two possible values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">, compromising between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> based on how likely each is. This is illustrated in the figure below. For a case with <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p%3C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D"> , two pebbles are being balanced on a seesaw. For the seesaw to balance, the fulcrum (shown as a triangle) must be at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">, which in physics terms is the <strong>center of mass</strong>. The frequentist interpretation would be to consider a large number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p"> of success. Writing <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1"> for “<strong>success</strong>” and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0"> for “<strong>failure</strong>”, in the long run, we would expect to have data consisting of a list of numbers where the proportion of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">’s is very close to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p">. The average of a list of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?0">’s and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">’s is the proportion of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1">’s. Note that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E(X)"> depends only on the distribution of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X">.</p>
<p>This follows directly from the definition but is worth recording since it is fundamental.</p>

<p>The moments of a r.v. shed light on its distribution. Everyone is quite familiar that the first two moments are useful since they provide the mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E(X)"> and the variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?V(X)%20=%20E%20%5Cleft(X%5E2%5Cright)%20-%20%5Cleft%5BE(X)%5Cright%5D%5E2">, which are important summaries of the average value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> and how to spread out its distribution is.

<p>Let us consider a collection of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?N"> particles.

<p>Now, locate the point with coordinates <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(X,%20Y,%20Z)">. This point is called the <strong><em>center of mass</em></strong> of the given collection of the particles. If the position vector of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%5E%7B%5Ctext%7Bth%7D%7D"> particle is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cvec%7Br_i%7D">, the center of mass is defined to have the position vector</p>

<p>Taking <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x,y,z"> components of this equation, we get the coordinates of center of mass as defined in equation <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?(5)">.</p>
<p>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> be a random variable with mean <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu"> and variance <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%5E2">. For any positive integer <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n">, the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?n%5E%7B%5Ctext%7Bth%7D%7D"> moment of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E(X%5En)"> and the central moment is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?E%5Cleft%5B%20(X-%5Cmu)%5Cright%5D%5En">. In particular, the mean is the firsfirst-ordertral moment and variance is the second-order central moment. The term moment is borrowed from physics. If you compare with it physics formula mean is specifically <strong>centre of mass.</strong></p>
<p>So, let us consider <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X"> to be a r.v. with positive realized values <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_1,%20x_2,%20%5Cldots,%20x_n"> and imagine a pebble with mass <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?m_j=P(X=x_j)"> positioned at <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x_j"> on a number line, for each <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.

<p>Physics interpretation of moments i.e., the mean (first moment) of an R.V. corresponds to the center of mass of a collection of pebbles, and the variance (second central moment) corresponds to the moment of inertia about the center of mass.</p>
<p>This mathematical formula holds for continuous cases also. Because if summation notation defines discrete case then there might be the continuous case which is true.</p>
</section>
<section id="center-of-mass-for-continuous-bodies" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="center-of-mass-for-continuous-bodies"><strong>Center of Mass for Continuous Bodies</strong></h3>
<p>If we consider the body to have a continuous distribution of matter, the summation in the formula of the center of mass should be replaced by integration. So, we don’t talk of the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?i%5E%7B%5Ctext%7Bth%7D%7D"> particle, rather we talk of a small element of the body having a mass <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?dm">, we denote the coordinates of the centre of mass as</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0AX%20=%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7BM%7D%20%5Cint%20xdm%5C%20,%5C%20Y%20=%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7BM%7D%5Cint%20ydm%5C%20,%5C%20Z%20=%20%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7BM%7D%5Cint%20zdm%0A"></p>
<p>The integration is to be performed under the proper limits so that as the integration variable goes through the limits, the elements cover the entire body.</p>
<p>This is the absolute beauty of moments. Mathematics has a beginning but there is no end. It is just like an expanding universe because both have no boundaries and don’t allow perfection. It is the only place where truth and beauty bring revolution.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Some people will tell you that it feels that way because of the false lens of social media, or because you’re being too self-critical,but it’s true , and it can be utilized for early detection and prevention of an outbreak. Mathematical paradoxes are fascinating brainteaser. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides">Epimenides</a> was a semi-mythical 7th or 6th century BC Greek seer and philosopher said that</p>

<p>In network science things are often not as they seem. Here we will explore the ‘<strong>Friendship Paradox</strong>’ and how it can be used early detection and prevention of an outbreak, how to detect and control infectious diseases.</p>
<section id="what-is-friendship-paradox" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-friendship-paradox">What is Friendship Paradox</h2>
<p>Friendship paradox was first described by mathematical sociologist and the person who should never be a middle school guidance counselor <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/author/scott_l._feld"><strong>Scott L. Feld</strong></a> in 1991 paper in the <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/toc/ajs/current"><strong>American Journal of Sociology</strong></a> entitled <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/229693"><strong>“Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You Do”</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The simplest way to think of the friendship paradox is as a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias">sampling bias</a>. So, if we were trying to figure out how many friends the average person has, we have to think about all the people in the world, and how many friends they have.</p>
<p>Before we get into the application of this paradox let’s spend couple of minutes to understand what it means and why it’s true.</p>

<p>At last we can say that <strong>D</strong> is connected with <strong>A.</strong> There are four individuals, and they have a combined total 8 friends.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 19px">
<p><strong><em>So on average, an individual has</em></strong> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B8%7D%7B4%7D%20=%202"> <strong><em>friends</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s take this one level deeper. <strong>A</strong> is a friend of 3 individuals, so we’ll put his friends list below each of those instances.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p><strong>B</strong> is friend of 2 individuals, so we put his friends list below each of those instances. <strong>C</strong> is also a friend of 2 individuals, so we put her friends list below of those instances. And <strong>D</strong> is a friend of 1 individual, so we put his friends list below that instance. So, the 4 individuals have a combined total of 8 friends, who have a combined total of 18 friends.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 19px">
<p><strong><em>So on average, an individual’s friend has</em></strong> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B18%7D%7B8%7D%20=%202.25"> <strong><em>friends</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>“On average an individual has fewer friends than his friends do”</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>And it’s that way because the popular individuals are over represented in the latter calculation. In other words, popular <strong>A</strong> shows up in each of the others individual friendship networks and thus can make them all feel relatively deprived, while unpopular <strong>D</strong> shows up in only <strong>A</strong>’s friendship network and can only make <strong>A</strong> feel relatively advantaged. It’s form of sampling bias in which people with more friends are more likely to be an individual’s friend group and this bias may have important applications for studying the dynamical process of social network, like detecting an outbreaks.</p>

<p>There are a lot of factors which affect one’s likelihood of contracting a virus. Some conditions are age, underlying health conditions, personal hygiene, airflow and ventilation conditions and positions within a social network. Individuals near the center of a social network are fewer steps away from the average individual in the network, so during the course of an outbreak, they are likely to be infected sooner than those at the periphery (all else being equal).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Christakis">Nicholas Christakis</a>, professor of medicine, medical sociology and sociology at Harvard University, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_H._Fowler">James Fowler</a>, professor of medical genetics and political science at the University of California, San Diego, used the paradox to study <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/8852307">the 2009 flu epidemic among 744 students</a>. The findings, the researchers say, point to a novel method for early detection of contagious outbreaks.</p>

<p>Red nodes correspond to infected individuals, yellow nodes correspond to friends of infected individuals, and node size is proportional to the number of friends infected. It’s subtle, but on average the red nodes are larger and in a greater concentration at the center of the network.</p>

<p>Infectious diseases are responsible for 32% death of worldwide with the biggest challenges in the poorest parts of the world. Inventing cheaper ways to detect and combat diseases especially in the most vulnerable areas is key. Infectious diseases are spread through contact between individuals via air particles or through direct physical contact.</p>

<p>If we look at social networks like graphs we can see who’s in contact with whom. In practice we probably don’t know precisely who’s in touch with whom or where the edges are and joints of the graph lie but we may know about its probability distribution.</p>
<section id="probability-distribution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="probability-distribution">Probability Distribution</h3>
<p>A probability distribution assigns a probability to a particular outcome. For example, when rolling a die each outcome has a probability of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B6%7D"> . These probability distributions also describe network.</p>

<section id="network" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="network">Network</h3>
<p>Network come in many different forms the simplest model is the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/erdos-renyl-model-generating-random-graphs/">erdos-renyi</a> network where each possible edges is drawn with a fix probability.</p>

<p>However when modeling the spread of infection on such a network epidemiologists and social scientists noticed that this model didn’t describe real social networks other models such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment">preferential attachment</a> better show how disease is spread through social network.</p>

<p>This model draws links depending on the existing number of links a point has just like how the rich become richer. We’re certain of vaccinations stop infectious diseases but if we can only afford to vaccinate a limited number of people or if a very infectious disease needs to be stopped quickly who should be targeted. Ideally we’d aim for the hub in the middle of the smaller networks as they have contact with the most people.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 19px">
<p><strong><em>But how can we identify who these hubs are ?</em></strong></p>

<p>If we randomly vaccinate people it’s highly unlikely that we’ll be successful. The friendship paradox says that <strong>on average your friends have more friends than you do</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="friendship-paradox-in-facebook-and-twitter">Friendship Paradox in Facebook and Twitter</h2>
<p>There is another form of outbreak which relates to the friendship paradox, things that go viral o the internet. And social media websites, like Facebook and Twitter, offer an ideal platform for studying the friendship paradox. They have huge global user bases and their connections are fully mapped out. In 2011, researchers studied the entire facebook social network and they found that 92.7% of users, on average, have fewer friends than their friends have.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong>In</strong> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2011"><strong>,</strong> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?721"> <strong>MILLION USERS</strong> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?68.7"> <strong>BILLION FRIENDSHIP</strong></p>
</div>
<p>If we look at twitter, twitter is a micro-blogging service on which users post short messages often accompanied by keywords marked by a hash to help them show up more easily in Twitter searches. Now unlike relations on facebook, Twitter relations are directional. When you follow someone, information flows in one direction. You get updates on their tweets, but not vice versa. You are the follower, they are the followee. In 2013, researchers studied a large portion of the global Twitter activity from 2009.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong>Dataset from</strong> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2009"><strong>,</strong></p>

</div>
<p>and they found that 98% of uers were less popular than their followers and their followees. In 2014, other researchers used a different 2009 twitter dataset to explore hashtags going viral, a form of digital contagion.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>They compared randomly chosen individuals with a random selection of people they followed, to see whether trending twitter hashtags were used sooner by the followee groups. In this study they analyzed the performance of the 32 most widespread hashtags that appeared in their ample groups. And they found that, on average, members of the followee group, used the hashtags before the random group for all but 2 hashtags with average lead time of 7.1 days suggesting that by simply monitoring the activity of the followee group, you can detect viral outbreaks of the use of novel hashtags one week earlier than if you had monitored a random group. And even though this example is just of a digital outbreak on the internet, knowledge of the online activity of a group known to be central to a network, has the potential to provide early insights into real-world outbreaks.</p>

But one of those reasons is that people are Googling the flu because they are sick with the flu. And if Google were able to identify the spikes associated with the latter, it could be useful to know the centrality of those sick people.</p>

<p>“<em>Music is the pleasure that human soul experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting</em>”— Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716).</p>
</div>
<p>One of the aspects of music that is based on tradition is which frequencies of sound may be used for ‘correct’ notes. The concept of the octave, where one note is twice the frequency of another is almost universal, but the number of other notes that may be found between is highly variable from one culture to another, as is the tuning of those notes.</p>
<p>In the western European tradition, there are twelve scale degrees, which are generally used in one or two assortments of seven. For the past hundred and fifty years or so, the tuning of these notes have been standardized as dividing the octave into twelve equal steps. The western equal tempered scale can then be defined as a series built by multiplying the last member by the twelfth root of two (1.05946). The distance between two notes is known by the musical term interval. (Frequency specifications are not very useful when we are talking about notes.) The smallest interval is the half step, which can be further broken down into one hundred units called cents.</p>

<h1><strong>Exponential Function vs Log Function</strong></h1>
<p>An exponential function is of the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20=%20b%5Ex"> . As you can see <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y"> rises very rapidly for positive values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> , and decays slowly for negative values of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x"> .</p>

<p>Many things in nature exhibit either exponential growth or decay; so one often describes their dynamics with an exponential relationship such as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y(t)%20=%20b%5E%7Bct%7D"> where the value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> determines how fast things grow or decay depending on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?c"> is positive or negative respectively.A logarithm is basically the inverse of the</p>

<p>You should confirm by comparison, that it is just the inverse of the exponential function i.e., it’s the same function, just flipped on its side.</p>

<section id="sound-intensity-the-decibel-scale" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Sound Intensity — The Decibel Scale</strong></h1>
<p>Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, observed that the difference in sound intensity that was needed to produce a perceptible change in the loudness of two tones increases proportional to the absolute intensity of the reference tone. That is, if you are comparing two very soft tones, then only a small change in intensity is need to perceive a difference. But if you are comparing two loud tones, then a larger change in intensity is needed to perceive the difference. Importantly, he found that the ratio of the intensities of the two tones needed to produce a perceptible difference was more or less constant, irrespective of the absolute intensity level one is at.</p>
<p>The ‘bel’ scale was named in Bell’s honor. It is just the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of intensity (power) of two sounds <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?difference%5C%20in%5C%20decibels%20=%20%5Clog_%7B10%7D%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7Bp_1%7D%7Bp_2%7D%5Cbigg)%20"></p>
<p>where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_1"> is the intensity of one sound and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?p_2"> is the intensity of other. Thus a difference of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?5"> bels means that the ratio of sound intensities is <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?100,000">. A ‘decibel’ is simply <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B10%7D"> of a bel, and is denoted by db. Thus, a difference of 5 bels is the same as a difference of 50 decibels. Oftentimes the quantity one measures in an experiment is amplitude (for example, the amplitude of air pressure variations), and since power (what we have been loosely calling intensity) is proportional to the square of the amplitude, we have,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0Adifference%5C%20in%5C%20decibels%20=%20%5Clog_%7B10%7D%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7Ba_1%7D%7Ba_2%7D%5Cbigg)%5E2%0A"> where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_1"> is the amplitude of one sound and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a_2"> is the amplitude of other.</p>
</section>
<section id="music" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Music</strong></h1>
<p>Perhaps one of the most interesting questions about music perception is why some intervals sound pleasing (consonant) and others sound harsh or difficult to bear (dissonant)?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/music-a-mathematical-camouflage/interval-table.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="516"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, the consonant intervals all have integer-fraction frequency ratios. The consequence of this is that their harmonics will tend to either align or else produce other consonant frequency ratios. For example, the second harmonic <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G"> will be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2%5Cbigg(%5Cdfrac%7B3%7D%7B2%7D%5Cbigg)=3"> times of the fundamental <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?C"> . Thus, the second harmonic of G exactly aligns with the third harmonic of C. But this still doesn’t answer all of our questions. What if we were to just play two pure tones that don’t have any harmonics. We still get dissonance when they are next to each other in frequency. Why? The answer seems to be that it has something to do with critical bandwidth–i.e., the region over which frequencies significantly interact within a nerve fiber, which is about <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D"> octave. The degree of perceived consonance between two tones depends on their relation to the critical bandwidth. If they are further apart than the critical bandwidth, then they are perceived to be consonant, but if within the critical bandwidth they are perceived dissonant. Of course, as the two tones become even closer to one another they again become consonant. Thus, there seems to be a relation between dissonance and the bandwidth of frequency-tuned mechanisms in the cochlea and auditory nerve, but what interactions occur exactly that give rise to the percept of dissonance, and how this is processed and represented by the nervous system, is currently unknown.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-modern-piano-and-mathematics" class="level1">
<h1><strong>The Modern Piano and Mathematics</strong></h1>
<p>The modern piano has been designed to have an equally-tempered scale, meaning that the ratio between the frequencies of any two adjacent notes—for example, C to C# is (approximately) the same no matter where you go on the keyboard. Thus, musical instruments have been designed around the logarithmic representation of frequency in the nervous system. Thus, a logarithmic scale provides a natural, intuitive way to describe sound intensity, because equal ratios, or equally discriminable sound levels, are converted to equal differences or intervals on the log-scale. Logarithmic scales provide a useful way to describe many types of natural phenomena.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/music-a-mathematical-camouflage/1662211322416.jfif" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="407"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>A lot of pianos look like an exponential because for waves on a string, doubling length means reducing a music pitch by an octave (2x the frequency). The “Stretched Harmonics” of a plain steel wire string produces an inharmonicity of pitch values produced by the High Tension (~200lbs.) on piano strings. This is why pianos have the “Chime like” sound of tone color rather than other stringed instruments which have lower string tension. (35-50lbs.). Eg. Nylon string classical guitar has a harmonic sonority close to a mathematical harmonic series.</p>
<p>Piano tones, though, are stretched by a geometric factor of “~1.1x” because of the physical high tension in the wire, and have that ’Bell Like” set of partials.</p>
<p>The tuning of piano by some professionals of piano keys will blend with each other, and are slightly higher (by an epsilon fraction) than a 2x doubling in octave frequency.</p>

<p>Consideration of black holes suggests, not only that God does play dice, but that he sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can’t be seen.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the most mysterious and fascinating objects in space are Black Hole, which is the ultimate manifestation of a region of strong gravitational attraction that not even light can escape its grasp and time stands still. The black hole cannot be perceived with our normal brain power because we have never directly witnessed the existence of such a thing. In this episode of Cosmic Charade, we will discuss this mysterious entity of the universe.</p>
<section id="introducing-black-hole" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introducing-black-hole">Introducing Black Hole</h2>
<p>The idea of the existence of a black hole was first proposed in the 18th century. This idea was proposed based on the only known gravitational laws. An English physician named John Michell published a paper in 1784 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (Vol. 84, p.&nbsp;35), with the rather rambling title ’On the Means of Discovering the Distance, Magnitude, etc. of the Fixed Stars, in Consequence of the Diminution of the velocity of the Light in the case of such a Diminution should be found to take place in any one of them, and such other Data should be Procured from Observations, as would be Further Necessary for that Purpose. In this paper, Michell discussed stars in general and speculated about the possibility of astronomical objects whose mass and radius satisfy the criteria for a black hole. Meanwhile, Michell wanted to explain that if an object has enough small size and mass enough, it is impossible for anything to escape its gravitational force. Even light can be stuck forever.</p>
<p>This same idea struck the French Mathematician Marquis de Laplace. He expressed the idea in his book ‘<em>The System Of The World’</em>. Laplace had carried out exhaustive research on Newtonian gravity and conceived of the notion of such an object in the year 1799. It is clear from his discussion that his concept implied the property of the escape speed exceeding the speed of light.’<em>Escape speed</em>’ is defined as the minimum speed with which a particle is to be ejected from the object in order that it never returns to the object. For the Earth, this speed works out as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?11.2"> kilometers per hour. Although Laplace or Michell did not use the term ‘<em>black hole</em>’ to describe these objects. Laplace’s work was based on the Newtonian theory of gravitation. Today when we discuss strong gravitational effects, we found that the Newtonian framework is questionable and we prefer to use Einstein’s general theory of relativity. It was Dr.&nbsp;John Archibald Wheeler, a visionary physicist who coined the term ‘<em>Black Hole</em>,’ at a conference in New York in 1967.</p>
<p>Albert Einstein first predicted the existence of black holes in 1916, with his general theory of relativity. Karl Schwarzschild developed the idea of black holes from relativity’s equations in 1916, just a year after Einstein published his theory. Schwarzschild’s solution identified a radius for any given mass, known as the <em>Schwarzschild radius</em>, where, if that mass could be compressed to fit within that radius, no known force or degeneracy pressure could stop it from continuing to collapse into a gravitational singularity or black hole. Thus, where the radius of the body is less than its Schwarzschild radius, everything, even photons of light, must inevitably fall into the central body. As a corollary, when the mass density of this central body exceeds a particular limit, it triggers a gravitational collapse to what is known as a Schwarzschild black hole, a non-charged, non-rotating black hole.</p>
<p>After decades of black holes being known only as theoretical objects. Around the 1930s J. Robert Oppenheimer, Volkoff and Snyder pondered the possibility of such objects in the universe. Later, these three scientists proved that, when a sufficiently competent star has lost all its fuel, it has no nuclear reaction to external pressure. As a result, the star begins to collapse under the influence of its own gravitational force. And this is how the idea of black holes was developed.</p>
</section>
<section id="structure-of-black-hole" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structure-of-black-hole">Structure of Black Hole</h2>
<p>Black holes have three “<em>layers</em>”: the outer and inner event horizon, and the singularity. The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the mouth of the black hole, past which light cannot escape. Once a particle crosses the event horizon, it cannot leave. Gravity is constant across the event horizon. The inner region of a black hole, where the object’s mass lies, is known as its singularity, the single point in space-time where the mass of the black hole is concentrated. Scientists can’t see black holes the way they can see stars and other objects in space. Instead, astronomers must rely on detecting the radiation black holes emit as dust and gas are drawn into the dense creatures. But supermassive black holes, lying in the center of a galaxy, may become shrouded by the thick dust and gas around them, which can block the tell-tale emissions.</p>

<p>There are three types of black holes: stellar black holes, super-massive black holes, and intermediate black holes.</p>
<section id="stellar-black-holes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stellar-black-holes">Stellar Black Holes:</h3>
<p>When a star burns through the last of its fuel, the object may collapse, or fall into itself. For smaller stars (those up to about three times the sun’s mass), the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress and creates a stellar black hole.</p>
</section>
<section id="supermassive-black-holes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="supermassive-black-holes">Supermassive Black Holes:</h3>
<p>Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, super-massive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun but are about the same size in diameter. Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way. Supermassive black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge.</p>
</section>
<section id="intermediate-black-holes" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intermediate-black-holes">Intermediate Black Holes:</h3>
<p>Scientists once thought that black holes came in only small and large sizes, but research has revealed the possibility that midsize, or intermediate, black holes (IMBHs) could exist. Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction. Several of these IMBHs forming in the same region could then eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a supermassive black hole. In 2014, astronomers found what appeared to be an intermediate-mass black hole in the arm of a spiral galaxy.</p>

<section id="black-hole-images" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="black-hole-images">Black Hole Images</h2>
<p>In 2019 the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration released the <a href="https://www.space.com/first-black-hole-photo-by-event-horizon-telescope.html">first image ever recorded</a> of a black hole. The EHT saw the black hole in the center of galaxy M87 while the telescope was examining the event horizon or the area past which nothing can escape from a black hole.</p>
<p>In 2021, astronomers revealed a new view of the giant black hole at the center of M87, showing what the colossal structure looks like in polarized light. As polarized light waves have a different orientation and brightness compared to unpolarized light, the new image shows the black hole in even more detail. Polarization is a signature of magnetic fields and the image makes it clear that the black hole’s ring is magnetized.</p>

<p>According to the cyclic model of the universe, the big bang itself wasn’t the very beginning. There was a very different phase of the universe that occurred previously to set up and give rise to the Big Bang. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)">cosmological inflation</a>. When and where inflation ends, a Big Bang occurs.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="time-runs-backward"><strong>Time runs Backward</strong></h2>
<p>A few years ago, there was a lot of media coverage of a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> scientist detecting a parallel universe. And in general, this is what they claim.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong>“At the moment of the Big Bang two universes were formed – ours, and another one that from our perspective is running in reverse.”</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The idea of parallel universes sparks our wildest dreams. If there are other universes where certain events had different outcomes—where just one crucial decision went a different way—perhaps there could be some way to access them. We could possibly live in a universe that is superior to our own in some ways if particles, fields, or even individuals could be transported from one to the other. These ideas have a foothold in theoretical physics as well, from the myriad of possible outcomes from quantum mechanics as well as ideas of the <strong>multiverse</strong>. Parallel universes are one of those intriguing ideas that sound imaginative but are very difficult to test. After all, we’re stuck in our own universe, and maybe there’s no way to test this idea about parallel universes. Because in all the experiments that scientists have ever performed, they’ve never found any strange interactions that require something outside of the governing physics to explain. For example, particles don’t simply appear, disappear, or transform. They can only interact with other quanta of matter and energy. We live in a universe that is governed by the law of physics. So, every interaction of particles must be uniformly governed by the same law.</p>
<p>There’s actually a link between this example and the media hype on the evidence of parallel universes. It appears that the claim about the evidence for parallel universes started from an article posted by <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/"><strong>New Scientist</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the post is backed up by a thought-provoking article about some puzzling results from an experiment conducted in Antarctica. So before we go any deeper, let’s first understand how the whole experiment works.</p>

<section id="helium-balloon-experiment-and-anita" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="helium-balloon-experiment-and-anita"><strong>Helium Balloon Experiment and ANITA</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Impulsive_Transient_Antenna"><strong>Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA)</strong></a> conducted a long-term helium balloon experiment. It is designed to detect radio signals generated by ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays. This helium balloon is flying over Antarctica, at a height of thirty-seven thousand meters.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/imaginary-world-next-to-ours/1668011884918.jfif" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="579"></p>

</div>
<p>Neutrinos, which are subatomic particles similar to electrons, have no electrical charge and are sometimes considered massless. These particles are abundant in the universe, and they are very hard to detect. Even now, scientists have estimated that millions of neutrinos are passing through every square centimetre of our skin, without leaving any clue. The main source of Neutrinos are stars and in our case, it is the Sun.</p>
<p>But when a very high energy neutrino particle passes through matter, they do interact with the matter and their interaction generates radio waves. If we can detect these radio waves, we can tell what kind of neutrino interaction it was, and through the direction of those radio waves, we can find where those neutrinos were coming from.</p>
<p>In 2016, ANITA made a very strange discovery. Usually, when neutrinos are detected, they come from outer space, because that is where the source lies. But, during ANITA’s flight in 2016, it detected Neutrinos that were not coming from space. Instead, it was coming from Earth. A neutrino can pass through Earth without interacting with it, but when it comes to high-energy neutrinos, they do interact with matter. During their collision with atoms, they produce some particles and radio waves. So, if highly energetic neutrinos do pass through the earth, they would interact with the Earth and generate radio waves. But the problem was that ANITA couldn’t detect those radio waves.</p>
<p>In Antarctica, where the ANITA experiment is being performed there is also another experimental setup that can detect neutrinos coming from the earth. This experimental setup is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory">IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a> run by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>. If some high-energy neutrinos pass through the earth, they can be detected through this observatory. But ANITA’s detection of these neutrinos the ground-based experimental setup didn’t detect any of them. This is impossible as far as scientists think but the helium balloon did this.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong>How can some neutrinos pass through the Earth and reach ANITA without being noticed by IceCube observatory?</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Even if we ignore this, then one of the possibilities is that there is some neutrino source on the other side of the earth, and it could be that these neutrinos came from that source. However, scientists believe that this hypothesis is incorrect. Because no known source can emit lots of high-energy neutrinos, which can pass through the earth and be detected through ANITA.</p>

<section id="our-possible-explanation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="our-possible-explanation"><strong>Our Possible Explanation</strong></h2>
<p>Our current understanding of the universe is not able to explain this weird phenomenon yet. So, we need to introduce some new physics to explain this. One of the possible explanations published in <strong><em>NewScientist</em></strong>caught attention worldwide. According to them</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong><em>“Explaining this signal requires the existence of a topsy-turvy universe created in the same big bang as our own and existing in parallel with it. In this mirror world, positive is negative, left is right and time runs backward.”</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>If that kind of universe does exist, which is dominated by anti-matter and somehow connected to ours, then that behavior of Neutrinos can be explained as moving backward in time. But when the scientists checked out all the data and did some math on it, it made the least possible explanation for the strange behavior of neutrinos.</p>
<p>Looking at the bigger picture, the problems facing the picture of our universe are not limited to what humans can perceive. The advancement of science, our mind, and our thinking condition the way we explore the universe and because of this, it may be that we have some kind of blind spot for the cosmic phenomena that run counter to human intuition and understanding.</p>

<p><strong>“The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.” ~ Neil deGrasse Tyson</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The idea of a parallel universe is super exciting. However, in this scenario, we haven’t found any parallel universes. So for now, based on scientific evidence, the idea that we have parallel universes will have to remain in science fiction dreams.</p>

  <title>Universe: From the Infinitesimals to Infinite</title>

<section id="early-story" class="level1">
<h1>Early Story</h1>
<p>The <strong>Big Bang</strong> happened 13.8 billion years ago, and the speed of light is constant, as far as we know it. Even though the universe might be infinite, the observable universe is finite. So perhaps, our universe may be just one minuscule region, in a larger multiverse.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/universe-from-infinitesimals-to-infinite/1667600771820.gif" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="297"></p>

</div>
<p>The multiverse. One of the most baffling questions in astrophysics is <strong>“are we a part of infinite universes?”</strong> So let’s take a look at this amazing theory of the multiverse, and do we live in one?</p>
<p>Before we go any deeper, let’s talk about some important concepts that lead us to understand the insight behind the multiverse.</p>
<section id="uniqueness" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="uniqueness">Uniqueness</h2>
<p>Uniqueness is one of those ideas that is unquestionable. There are very low chances of something being identical to it. Just like your fingerprints. But in a very recent picture of the cosmos, which says nothing is unique, the very notion of uniqueness is being challenged. It says that there might be duplicates of everything. Not only of objects but of me, you, everyone, and everything else. And if it’s right, why haven’t we seen them? And where are they?</p>
<p>There was a time when the idea of a multiverse seemed impossible. But in recent years, scientists have discovered some compelling evidence of other universes. Some are born all the time. They might look identical to ours, having the same star and even the same planets. They might also have our duplicates, very identical to us. Except for the slightest details. In another universe, it might be possible that we would be dying or being born. We could be getting married. Or perhaps, we could even be the prime minister of India. Of course, not us per se, but our identical selves.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong><em>But how it is possible? Doesn’t this idea seem absurd?</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Let us take a look at why this idea is compelling, not only to us but also to the scientists.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-root" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-root">The Root</h2>
<p>We all know about the Big Bang theory. It tells us about the massive explosion that led to the formation of our universe. But the Big Bang misses one thing, it doesn’t tell us anything about the bang.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong><em>What caused the bang? And how it banged?</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Our universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. This means that everything is moving away from each other because the space between them is expanding. In 1979, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Guth">Alan Guth</a> was studying the particles in the early universe. He observed that in the early universe, under violent and harsh environments, gravity can be repulsive. The <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/461/3/2929/2608669">repulsive gravity</a> would drive apart everything around and repel it, causing a massive expansion. This force was so powerful that it could take a molecule, and blow it up to the size of a Galaxy, in less than a billionth of a blink of an eye. This idea gave birth to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe">the theory of inflation</a>.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Then, the theory of multiverse gained unexpected support from two major areas of modern science, and these may be the key to understanding the many important phenomenons, in our universe and beyond.</p>
</section>
<section id="dark-energy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dark-energy">Dark energy</h2>
<p>In the twentieth century, astronomers believed that the universe might be shrinking, or might be slowing down. The analogy is like when you throw a ball up in the air, it comes back to you after some time. Astronomers believed that the universe was expanding and thought it would slow down. Because of the gravitational pull of the stars and galaxies. But when detailed observations were made, especially by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a>, astronomers observed that the universe was not slowing down. Instead, it was accelerating outwards. Everything was moving away from each other at an increasing speed. Scientists believed there had to be an invisible force behind this. Astronomers called it dark energy. Dark Energy is one of the most important discoveries in astrophysics. However, there was another aspect of this strange force. Its strength. Scientists believed that at the quantum level, the amount of energy that would be generated is gigantic. When astronomers measured the amount of dark energy present in our universe it was in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?10%5E%7B-120%7D">.</p>
<p>Imagine a number so small, it has 119 zeros after the decimal points. That seems like an infinitely small number.</p>
<p>Astronomers found out that if this tiny amount of dark energy would have been just slightly larger or lower; life as we know it wouldn’t exist.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong><em>How can this amount of dark energy be so perfect for our universe?</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>The multiverse gives us the answer. The amount of dark energy differs in every universe. In some,</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/universe-from-infinitesimals-to-infinite/1667584595271.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="495"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>it might be so less that the matter would collapse in on itself, and hence nothing could exist. In others, dark energy is so large that matter could never get a chance to form and nothing wouldn’t even exist. And this was a baffling realization for scientists.</p>
<section id="types-of-multiverse" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-multiverse">Types of Multiverse</h3>
<p>According to&nbsp;cosmologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tegmark">Max Tegmark</a>, there are four different levels of multiverses. From thoughts that are generally accepted by prominent scientists, to even some outlandish speculations. The four levels of Tegmark’s classification are arranged such that subsequent levels can be understood to encompass and expand upon previous levels.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong><em>Max Tegmark&nbsp;and&nbsp;Brian Greene&nbsp;have devised classification schemes for the various theoretical types of multiverses and universes that they might comprise.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>We’ll simply go over the first two of these levels in this article.</p>
</section>
<section id="level-i-multiverse-the-least-contentious" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="level-i-multiverse-the-least-contentious">Level-I Multiverse: The least contentious</h3>
<p>This is based on the fundamental notion that space is infinite, reaching out in all directions indefinitely toward the horizon. The assumption is that, since our universe is so vast and gigantic, it must inevitably replicate itself at some point, in another space or time. Life may start in a galaxy far, far away from where we are.&nbsp;And that life will develop into beings who will live in a world similar to Earth. If this is true, it would properly explain the presence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger">doppelgangers</a>, or beings who are slightly different from each other.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Tegmark concluded that if such a perfect pair of doppelgangers existed, they would be somewhere at a distance of&nbsp;10^118 meters away from one another. It’s three times larger than our current observable universe.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="level-ii-multiverse-an-endless-collection-of-various-space-time-dimensionalities">Level-II Multiverse: An endless collection of various space-time dimensionalities</h3>
<p>The basic idea here is that, as the vacuum of space continues to expand, it permits various configurations of each physical constant to vary by a minuscule amount, in another set of universes. Perhaps just&nbsp;a tiny&nbsp;change in those&nbsp;constants would allow one specific universe to have a different set of governing physical laws.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong>We might wonder naively: “What’s the worst that might happen if we modify the fundamental constants of our universe?”</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Scientists use the power of supercomputers, to churn through intertwined equations. Potentially looking at the other sets of universes, and unraveling the deep mysteries of what these alternate universes would look like. Here’s a bigger picture of how that methodology works.</p>
<p>We have the universe’s parameters as a starting point. These include things like the value of the cosmological constant, the gravitational constant, the mass of quarks, etc. Now, we add these rather peculiar numbers in each row, down to the last digit, and as a result, we have... the universe as we know it! The gravitational pull, quark mass, or even dark energy would be just right to allow our universe to exist.</p>
<p>However, if we put a vastly different value in each of those rows, the simulation&nbsp;indicates that the only thing that would emerge is... nothingness. Then we make another addition to our table, this time with something that is a little closer&nbsp;to our physical constants. So we copy these&nbsp;numbers but adjust them&nbsp;somewhat, not by much.&nbsp;After a while, in the third possible universe, the same nothingness will arise in that possible reality.</p>
<p>If we simply copy and paste the same numbers from our universe and tweak one of the data points by a few percentage points, we will also get nothing! You and I wouldn’t exist. If we repeat this data entry for some time, we’ll discover an immense pool of darkness and nothingness in the process.</p>
<p>But there was another piece of this puzzle missing which lead us to unfold another concept.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 17px">
<p><strong>How can we be so sure about this diversification of universes, so that every value of dark energy including the value of our universe, can be found somewhere else?</strong></p>

<p>String theory proposes that at subatomic levels, small particles (here we will call quarks) are made up of small vibrating loops of energy, or strings.

String theory also proposes extra dimensions of space.</p>

<p>It would see an extra dimension. And if we could shrink down billions of times than the ants, we’ll find extra dimensions curled up into loops, everywhere in space. The shape of those dimensions determines how the strings will vibrate. And this vibration of space defines the different properties of the particles.</p>
<p>When scientists tried to figure out these different shapes, they were blown away by the million possibilities of shapes, each as unique as the other one and this was heartbreaking for them. What good is a theory that has billions of solutions, finding anything would almost be impossible. But some string theories thought to look at the problem differently, a way that would lead to a multiverse.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fits-for-cosmology">Fits for Cosmology</h2>
<p>This diversification of possible shapes says that string theory fits perfectly for cosmology and multiverse. All these different shapes might correspond to a different unique universe. At the end of the day, cosmologists can see three different theories pointing to a single theory <strong>the theory of the multiverse</strong>. Different lines of research were focusing on one idea, and the theory of multiverse seemed convincing. All the various alternative universes out there might have a different amount of dark energy naturally and the unique shapes of these extra dimensions.</p>
<p>In the future, we might see other advances in this research. But as of now, we can’t observe beyond the observable universe as the space between these galaxies and the space itself is expanding.</p>

<p><strong>Technology has changed the way people make music. It started with a phonograph in 1877, invented by Thomas Edison that used complex moving parts, and now companies like Hexachords use AI in their software called Orb Producer Suite where all we have to do is click one button. Literally one button and you get everything ready for you, from melodies to chords to drum loops and so on.</strong></p>

<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>One of the difficult aspects of the study of electronic music is the accurate description of the sounds used. With traditional music, there is a general understanding of what the instruments sound like, so a simple notation of “violin” or “steel guitar” will convey enough of an aural image for study or performance. In electronic music, the sounds are usually unfamiliar, and composition may involve some very delicate variations in those sounds. In order to discuss and study such sounds with the required accuracy, we must use the tools of mathematics. There will be no proofs or rigorous developments, but many concepts will be illustrated with graphs and a few simple functions.</p>
<p>The first thing musicians must do before they can play together is “tune.” For musicians in the standard Western music tradition, this means agreeing on exactly what pitch (or what frequency) is an”A,” what is a “B flat,” and so on. Other cultures not only have different note names and different scales, but they may even have different notes—different pitches—based on a different tuning system. In fact, the modern Western tuning system, which is called equal temperament, has (relatively recently) replaced other tuning systems that were once popular in Europe. All tuning systems are based on the physics of sound. But they are all also affected by the history of their music traditions, as well as by the tuning peculiarities of the instruments used in those traditions.</p>
<section id="the-science-of-tuning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-science-of-tuning">The Science of Tuning</h2>
<p>Many musical instruments, including pianos, guitars, and violins, make a sound when strings are plucked, hit, or set in vibration in some other way. When you pluck a string, it vibrates at a certain frequency according to its length and tension, and these vibrations are sensed by the ear and relayed to the brain. If you pluck a bunch of strings together, it can either sound nice or downright awful, depending upon the frequency relationships among the strings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A guitarist may play an open string, say G, and then place a finger on a fret to create a sound with a higher pitch, say G#, A, or B. What is happening is that the player is shortening the vibrating part of the string to produce a higher pitch. This is based on the fundamental fact that shorter (skinner or tighter) strings produce higher pitches. Similar facts are true with woodwind, percussion, and other types of instruments in general: the smaller the vibrating portion gets, the higher the sound becomes. That is why, for instance, a tuba is bigger than a French horn, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrabass_flute"><strong>Contrabass Flute</strong></a> is longer than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soprano_flute"><strong>Soprano Flute</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<section id="brief-explanation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brief-explanation">Brief Explanation</h2>
<p>Suppose we pluck a string of a certain length and create a wave, a vibration of the air. The string will move up and down in oscillation. Each wave, whether it is a simple water wave, sound, earthquake, radio wave, microwave, or light wave, has a frequency, which measures how many times the oscillation occurs in a given time period, such as one second. For sound, the frequency is measured in <strong>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_per_second">cycles per second</a>”</strong>&nbsp;(abbreviated “<em>cps</em>”), sometimes called “<em>hertz</em>” (denoted “<em>Hz</em>”). Frequency is what determines the pitch of the sound generated by the vibration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a string is plucked and set in motion, the entire string vibrates, as shown in the picture above. The frequency created by the whole string is referred to as the “fundamental frequency” of the string. It generates the lowest sound the string can possibly make. This is equivalent to playing an open string on the guitar. If the guitar is tuned in the standard way, the sixth string (the thickest one, located on the top) is the E string, meaning that its fundamental frequency corresponds to the pitch we call an “E”. This is the lowest sound a guitar can play.</p>
<p>Now, if we take that same string, press the midpoint of it, and pluck it, only half of the string would vibrate, shortening the wavelength to half and doubling the frequency. This, of course, results in a higher pitch. But how much higher? When the frequency is doubled, we call the interval between those two pitches an “octave” (meaning 8). For instance, if the open string has a frequency of 440 cps, then the half string would have a frequency of 880 cps, and that sound is called an octave higher than the first. One can, of course, keep making the vibrating portion shorter and shorter to create higher and higher sounds.</p>

<section id="pythagoras-numbers-music-and-harmony" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pythagoras-numbers-music-and-harmony">Pythagoras: Numbers, Music, and Harmony</h2>
<p>Music has existed in different cultures for millennia, but it was Pythagoras, an ancient Greek mathematician, and philosopher, who explicitly linked sound (pitch) with frequency (number), laying a foundation of music theory based on mathematics. It was known to Pythagoras that two notes (sounds with different frequencies) sound nice together (harmonious, pleasant) when the ratio of the two frequencies is a simple fraction. For instance, two pitches that are an octave apart have a ratio of 2 to 1, as described above. 2/1 (or its reciprocal ½) is a simple fraction, and these two notes sound nice if played simultaneously. In fact, if two people sing a song one octave apart, it could sound almost like unison. These simple fractions give rise to well-known interval names in music theory:</p>

<p>These simple ratios became a foundation for various musical scales and musical chords. For this reason, sometimes Pythagoras is called the father of music theory. In fact, as a religious and philosophical leader, he taught that ratios create harmony, which forms beauty in nature; therefore, ratios are divine. His followers, called the Pythagoreans, thus did not believe in the existence of numbers that were not ratios of integers. It is then quite ironic that Pythagoras himself later proved that the square root of 2 (the length of the hypotenuse of a right isosceles triangle whose two sides are 1 unit long) is irrational, contradicting his own teaching that every number is rational. (By the way, this number, 2, came about by a theorem named after him—the Pythagorean Theorem!) Regardless of this devastating discovery, numerical ratios played a very significant role in the composition of musical scales.</p>
<p>Throughout history, there have been many musical scales in various cultures, traditions, genres, and generations. Many authors have documented a wide variety of scales and methods of tuning instruments.

<p><em>Some people look for value in their lives through material success, through personal relationships. But being blessed with the intellect to decipher the nature’s deepest secret gives enough meaning to our life. These words from Michio Kaku will profusely enhance your fundamental connectedness to the universe.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Since childhood, we have been taught to be perfect men or women in some sense. But do we really become so after ages? Do we really know what or why it is called “Perfect”? Ideally, a situation or system is termed perfect when each component is acted upon in order, either sequentially or systematically. In our society, perfection is often looked upon as an ultimatum. But from a broader perspective, this is not the case. According to Stephen Hawking—“One of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect. Perfection simply doesn’t exist... Without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist.”</p>
<p>Perfection readily breaks down in the presence of minute disorder or disturbance, which is ubiquitous in any system. So, nobody can be perfect in absolute terms. From this point on, things get complicated and tend toward disorder. More specifically, the second law of thermodynamics states that “as one goes forward in time, the net entropy (degree of disorder) of any isolated or closed system will always increase (or at least stay the same).” Basically, entropy is a measure of the disorder of the universe on both macro and microscopic levels, an important mental model as it applies to every part of our lives. Contemplating entropy will fundamentally change our perspective on the world.</p>
<div style="font-family: georgia; font-size: 22px; text-align: center">
<p><strong><em>Disorder is not a mistake; it is our default. Order is always artificial and temporary.</em></strong></p>

<section id="the-discovery-of-entropy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-discovery-of-entropy">The Discovery of Entropy</h2>
<p>The idea of entropy was attributed to Rudlof Clausins (1822–1888), a German mathematician and physicist. During his research work on the conversion of heat into work, he observed the transmission of heat from a body at a high temperature to a lower one. The same mechanism is followed when coffee cools down and the heat from coffee flows into the room, naturally and spontaneously. But if you want to heat the cold water to enjoy your coffee, you need to do some work—you need a power source to heat the water. From this idea comes his statement of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the few concepts that validate the existence of time is entropy. Entropy always decreases as we move forward in time. We experience a single direction, or “Arrow of Time”, from the past to the future. From this point, a question arises—can we change the course of events? Most scientists will tell you no. Causal determinism forbids it. Time loops have a significant impact on the principle of causality on the relationship between cause and effect. Therefore, everything is mutually dependent. The past does not just influence the future, the future also influences the past. It is just like the question of the chicken and the egg. We can no longer say which of the two came first. Everything is connected to everything else.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>There is a switch point at the junction in the loop of time. The moment that allows things to run in one direction or the other. You do something, or you don’t. A line that meets itself again in the loop creates two possible paths: along the outer edge of the line or along the inner edge of the line. And yet it is the same line. Two overlapping realities. On one of these paths, you are a painter, on the other, you are a singer. Both possibilities recur in the loop, again and again, one triggering the other. Scientists call it Quantum Entanglement.</p>
<p>It is human nature to believe that we play a role in our own lives and destiny. Everyone should adhere to it. As Brian Cox said, “The Arrow of Time dictates that as each moment passes, things change, and once these changes have happened, they are never undone. Permanent change is a fundamental part of what it means to be human. We all age as the years pass by—people are born, they live, and they die. It’s part of the joy and tragedy of our lives, but out there in the universe, those grand and epic cycles appear eternal and unchanging. But that’s an illusion. In the life of the universe, just as in our lives, everything is irreversibly changing.”</p>

<p>If everything has a purpose, and if so, who decides this purpose? Coincidence? God? Or is it us? Are we actually free in our actions? Or is it all created in an eternally recurring cycle? And we can only obey the laws of nature and are nothing but slaves of space and time. Mankind has always been puzzled over its origin and its genesis. Are we created by God or a product of evolution? If we could see yesterday and tomorrow at the same time, the origin and the end, the entire universe in a single moment, we might find the answers to the biggest question of all. What are we and where do we come from? What drives us and what are our purposes? Why do we decide one thing against another? But does it matter whether the decision is based upon the consequences of a series of causal links? Or whether it stems from an undefined feeling inside us? That perhaps everything in our lives boils down to this one moment. We are part of a puzzle. The pieces of a jigsaw puzzle should be put together since everything had to happen the way it always has. Nobody can do everything, but everybody can do something. Let them do that on their own. That’s how the cosmic balance of the system should be maintained through the fabric of space-time. If one can sing well, let him/her be a singer. Don’t impose him/her forcefully with a mere tag of a scientist. Everyone should follow through with what is assigned to them only. Otherwise, it will create chaos. All our lives are somehow connected.</p>

<section id="made-for-each-other" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="made-for-each-other">Made for each Other</h2>
<p>On the other hand, every element of the cosmos and the structure of the universe permits life to exist. The anthropic perspective of the quantum cosmological models predicts the structure of the universe probabilistically. The laws of nature are so arranged that life and consciousness are possible. Is there any deity who deliberately arranged these laws to make life possible, or are we the by-products of a series of lucky accidents or coincidences? As physicist Freeman Dyson once said, “It’s as if the universe knew that we were coming.” The idea that the fine-tuning of the physical constants were not an accident but implies a grand design of the universe. Every element in this universe has its own purpose to serve. We are not free in what we do, because we are not free in what we desire. We cannot overcome what is deep within us.</p>
<p>In the end, there is a subliminal connection between these two seemingly incompatible perceptions, leading to our own existence in the universe. Our life is defined as everything in between birth and death and it exists there ad infinitum. Thus, we exist in this universe, and therefore the universe exists in a way that it allows observers to come into existence.</p>

<p><strong>Apparent slowing down of time is one of the strangest side-effects of intense fear…</strong></p>
</div>
<section id="the-beginning" class="level1">
<h1>The Beginning</h1>
<p>One evening in the spring of 1905 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, the patent clark in Bern, after wrap-up his days work he decided to board a tram car on his way home. Einstein would often wrap up his work as soon as possible to contemplate the truths of the universe in his free time. It was one of these thought experiments he devised on that tram car that revolutionized modern physics forever.</p>
<section id="thought-experiment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thought-experiment">Thought Experiment</h2>
<p>While receding away from the Zytglogge clock tower Einstein imagined and extended his imagination.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p><strong><em>What would happen if the tram car were receding at the speed of light ?</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>He realized that if he were to travel at 186000 miles per second the clocks hands would appear to completely freeze. At the same time Einstein knew that back at the clock tower the hands would tick along at their normal pace. For Einstein time had slowed down.</p>
<p>This thought blew his mind.Einstein concluded that ’<strong>the faster you move through space the slower you move through time’</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="motivation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Einstein’s work was heavily influenced by two of the most iconic physicists of all time. First there were <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/equation-of-motion"><strong>the laws of motion</strong></a> discovered by his idol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Issac Newton</a> and second were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Maxwell%27s_equations"><strong>laws of electromagnetism</strong></a> laid down by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>.</p>
<section id="newtons-observation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="newtons-observation">Newton’s Observation</h3>
<p>Newton’s laws insisted that velocities are never absolute but always relative , so that their magnitudes must be appended by the phrase “with respect to”.</p>
<p>For instance a train travels at 40 km/h with respect to someone at rest. However, it only travels with respect to a train travelling 20 km/h in the same direction or it travels 60 km/h with respect to another train travelling in the opposite direction at 20 km/h. This is also true for the velocities of Earth, the Sun and the and the entire Milky Way galaxy.</p>
</section>
<section id="maxwells-observation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="maxwells-observation">Maxwell’s Observation</h3>
<p>On the other hand Maxwell found that the speed of an electromagnetic wave such as light is fixed at an exorbitant <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?299,792,458"> m/s regardless of who observes it. However, Maxwell’s notion seems incompatible with Newton’s notion of relative velocities.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 19px">
<p><strong><em>If Newton’s laws are truly universal , why should the speed of the light be an exception?</em></strong></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="way-to-revolution">Way to Revolution</h2>
<p>This presented Einstein with a daunting dilemma. This conflict between the ideas of Newton and Maxwell can be demonstrated with another of Einstein’s brilliant thought experiments.</p>
<p>Einstein imagined himself on a train platform witnessing two lightning bolts strike on either side of him. Now because Einstein stands precisely in the middle of the two strikes he receives the resulting beams of light from both sides at the same time. However, things get more complicated when someone on a passing train views this event while whizzing past Einstein at the speed of light. If the speed of light conforms to the rules of relativity, then the person on the train wouldn’t weakness the lightning strike simultaneously.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 19px">
<p><strong><em>Logically the light closure to the man on the train would reach him first.</em></strong></p>

<p>A measurement of the speed of light made by both men would differ in magnitude, this would contradict an apparently fundamental truth of the universe. Einstein had to make a difficult choice. Either Newton’s laws were incomplete or the speed of light wasn’t a universal constant. Einstein realized that the two notions could coexist with a small tweak in Newton’s laws.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?2c%20=%20%5Cdfrac%7Bd%7D%7Bt%7D"></p>

<p>To get rid of the discrepancy in the measurements Einstein suggested the time itself for the man of the train must slow down to compensate for the decrease in speed such that the magnitude remains a constant.</p>

<p>Newton believed the time moved unflinchingly in a single direction forward. Einstein however had just realized the time stretches and contracts varying with velocity. Due to its malleability time like space deserved its own dimension in fact Einstein claimed that the two were one and the same together they formed a four dimensional fabric or continuum called space-time upon which the mundane events of the universe would unfold.</p>

<p>Einstein suggested that massive objects like the Sun didn’t pull bodies like earth with mysterious Inexplicable tug, but rather curved the fabric of space-time around them. Forcing earth to fall down into this steep valley.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intuitive-explanation">Intuitive Explanation</h3>
<p>A highly simplified analogy is the dip in a trampoline made by a falling bowling ball. If a marble were placed on that trampoline the marble would immediately roll towards the bowling ball in the center. This is also true for the Earth’s gravity. We’re pinned to the ground because space so distorted by the Earth’s mass pushes us down from above. However, the slump in the fabric around Earth is not uniform and Earth’s gravity grows more intense as we move towards its center where the curvature is at a maximum.</p>

<p>Therefore like the marble on the trampoline an object that falls towards the earth accelerates as it races towards the center of the planet. It falls faster when just above the surface than it does say when it is slightly above the atmosphere. But according to special relativity the faster you move through space the slower you move through time. This means that time runs slower on Earth’s surface then it does above the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Different planets have different masses and the different gravitational strength. They also accelerate objects at different rates as he have learnt this means a variable passage of time.</p>
<p>This what happened in the movie ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)">Interstellar</a>’ when the protagonist land on a planet in the proximity of a black hole.</p>

<p>To understand how motion effects time let’s considered the simplest timekeeping mechanism. A second passes each time the photon is reflected.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine two people one in a spaceship slightly above Earth’s atmosphere and the second on top of a small hill just above the Earth’s surface. Both are watching a man fall from space towards the ground.</p>
<p>Let’s say that the falling man is carrying the photon clock</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p><strong><em>What to each of the two man observe as the man falls pass them ?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What they observe is eerily similar to what a stationary person would observe when watching a ball bounce in a moving train ?</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/the-truth-of-the-universe/exp.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="459"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As the man falls from the space, the light in his clock would appear to move in triangles to the observers.This would mean that light travels a longer distance consequently stretching the duration of a second. It’s obvious that the length of triangles the light traces and therefore the duration of a second is proportional to the velocity of the falling man.</p>
<p>When we recall that objects closer to the center of the planet fall faster . We can determine the time would appear to pass slower to the man on the hill than it does to the man in the spaceship above. Of course the difference is infinitesimal. The difference between the time measured by clocks at the tops of mountains and at the surface of Earth is a matter of nano seconds.Time dilation affects every clock whether it relies on basic electromagnetism or a complex combination of electromagnetism and Newton’s laws of motion. In fact even biological processes are slowed down.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s right your head is slightly older than your feet.</p>

<h1>Concept of Infinity</h1>
<p>In the 1920s, the German mathematician <a href="http://%28https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert"><strong>David Hilbert</strong></a>) devised a famous thought experiment to show how hard it is to wrap our minds around the concept of infinity.</p>

<p>Imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms and a very hardworking night manager. One night, the infinite Hotel is completely full, totally booked up with an infinite number of guests.</p>

<p>A man walks into the hotel and asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides to make room for him.</p>

<p>He asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room number 2, the guest in room number 2 to move to room number 3, and so on. Every guest moves from room number n to room number n+1. Since there is an infinite number of rooms, there is a new room for each existing guest. One who leaves room open for the new customer. The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p><strong><em>There may not be a last room , but there’s always a next room.</em></strong></p>

<p>The rooms as a set ranging from 1 to an infinite number n.&nbsp;There isn’t the last room, but there is always the next room. So the trick is to simultaneously move each person to the next room.</p>

<p>After we move all the guests we are left with room 1 unoccupied. In fact, we can use this same method to free up any finite number of rooms we need whether it’s 1, 50, or 50 million. Pretty nifty huh?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="story-2-an-infinite-bus-arrives">Story 2: An Infinite Bus Arrives</h2>
<p>If, say, a tour bus unloads 40 new people looking for rooms, then every existing guest just moves from room number n to room number n+40, thus opening up the first 40 rooms, but now an infinitely large bus with a countably infinite number of passengers pulls up to rent rooms (countably infinite is the key). Now, the infinitely large bus of infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there’s a way to place each new person. He asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room number 2. He then asks the guest in room number 2 to room number 4 and room number 3 to room number 6 and so on.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p><strong><em>Each current guest moves from room number ‘n’ to room number 2n filling up only the infinite even-numbered rooms. By doing this , he has now emptied all of the infinitely many odd-numbered rooms, which are then taken by the people filling off the infinite bus.</em></strong></p>

<p>If we move each current guest to 2 times their current room number, we’ll find a new room for each of the current infinite guests and be able to put all of our new guests in the infinite set of odd-numbered rooms left over.</p>

<p>Everyone is happy and the hotel’s business is booming more than ever. Actually, it’s booming exactly the same amount as ever, banking an infinite number of rupees a night. Word spreads about this incredible hotel. People pour in from far and wide.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="story-3-an-infinite-number-of-infinite-busses-arrives">Story 3: An Infinite Number of Infinite Busses Arrives</h2>
<p>One night, the unthinkable happens. The night manager looks outside and sees an infinite line of infinitely large buses, each with a countably infinite number of passengers.</p>
<section id="what-can-he-do" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-can-he-do">What Can he do?</h3>

</figure>
</div>
<p>If he can’t find the rooms for them, the hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money, and he will surely lose his job. Luckily, he remembers that around the year 300 B.C.E., Euclid proved that there is an <a href="http://%28https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem"><strong>infinite quantity of prime</strong></a>.) numbers.</p>
<p>So to accomplish this seemingly impossible task of finding infinite beds for infinite buses of infinite weary travelers, the night manager assigns every current guest to the first prime number 2 raised to the power of their current room number.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p><strong><em>The current occupant of room number 7 goes to room number which is room 128. The night manager then takes the people on the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their seat number on the bus. So, the person in seat number 7 on the first bus goes to room number or room number 2187.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>This continues all of the first buses. The passenger on the second bus is assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7. Each bus follows the power of 11, powers of 13, powers of 17, etc. Since each of these numbers only has 1 and the natural number powers of their prime number base as factors, there are no overlapping room numbers. All of the buses’ passengers fan out into rooms using unique room assignment schemes based on unique prime numbers. In this way, the night manager can accommodate every passenger on every bus. Although, there will be many rooms that go unfilled, like room 6, since 6 is not a power of any prime number. Luckily, his bosses weren’t very good at mathematics, so his job is safe.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p>The night manager’s strategies are only possible because while the infinite hotel is certainly a logistical nightmare, it only deals with the lowest level of infinity, mainly, the countable infinity of the natural numbers, 1,2,3,4 and so on.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://%28https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>) called this level ‘<a href="http://%28https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number"><strong>infinity aleph-zero</strong></a>.)’ We use natural numbers for the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses. If we are dealing with higher orders of infinity, such as that of the real numbers, these structured strategies would no longer be possible as we have no way to systematically include every number.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p>The real number infinite hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms, so the guy in room ½ always suspects he has less room than the guy in room 1. Square root rooms, like room radical 2, and room π, where the guests expect free desert.</p>
</div>

<section id="what-self-respecting-night-manager-would-ever-want-to-work-there-even-for-an-infinite-salary" class="level3">

<p>At Hilbert’s infinite hotel, where there’s never any vacancy and always room for more, the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent and may be too hospitable night manager serves to remind us of just hard it is for our relatively finite minds to grasp a concept of as larger as infinity. Maybe you can help tackle these problems after a good night’s sleep. But honestly, we might need someone to change rooms at 2 am.</p>

<p><strong>Intellectual fascination crosses many boundaries. Here, Paradoxes lead us to define and push our intellectual boundaries which comes from our intellectual fascination.</strong></p>
</div>
<section id="distinct-from-our-opinion" class="level1">
<h1><strong>Distinct from Our Opinion</strong></h1>
<p>There is a dilemma i.e., you have three envelopes and you can choose only one. They are red, white and brown.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/towards-crossing the-intellectual-boundaries/Envelope.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="375"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>‘Di’</strong> comes from the Greek for ‘twice’ and <strong>‘lemma’</strong> means ‘premise’. So, a dilemma involves two premises from which you have to choose. Adding a third envelope means this isn’t technically a dilemma. But it does set up a very famous paradox.</p>
<p>Let’s dissect the word paradox like we just did with a dilemma to find out what a paradox is.<strong>‘Para’</strong> comes from the Latin ‘distinct from’ and <strong>‘dox’</strong> comes from ‘doxa’, meaning <strong>“our opinion”. Paradox</strong> translates literally as <strong>“distinct from our opinion”.</strong></p>
<section id="brain-teaser" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="brain-teaser">Brain Teaser</h2>
<p>People think the paradox is like an unsolvable brain teaser. So, how do three envelopes set up a paradox?</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/towards-crossing the-intellectual-boundaries/conf.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="259"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In 1961, logician and philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine"><strong>Willard Van Orman Quine</strong></a>outlined the three categories of paradoxes. Let’s consider that I have them each hidden inside these three envelopes. One represents the kind of paradox that you’re most familiar with. Those that defy logic are like the <strong>Impossible Waterfall</strong>. The Waterfall painted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_(M._C._Escher)"><strong>Maurits Cornelis Escher</strong></a>.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, What if I open the envelope which is red and it comes “<strong>Falsidical”</strong>?This is why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles"><strong>Achilles</strong></a> can never catch a tortoise.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Tortoise_Said_to_Achilles"><strong>What the Tortoise Said to Achilles.</strong></a></p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/towards-crossing the-intellectual-boundaries/Tortoise Said Achilles.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="261"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Assuming that, if the tortoise gets a 100-meter head start, then Achilles starts running, by the time he gets to the 100-meter mark, the tortoise will have moved another meter. It takes Achilles some more time to get to that 101-meter mark and in that time, the tortoise has moved forward even further.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/towards-crossing the-intellectual-boundaries/Zeno_para.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="445"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Achilles will always be catching up to the place the tortoise was as the tortoise inches forward. The gap will get smaller, but the tortoise is always slightly ahead. According to Greek philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea"><strong>Zeno of Elea</strong></a>, who dreamed up&nbsp;this paradox 2500 years ago, the fastest runner in the world can never overtake a tortoise in a race because you infinitely divide the distance between them as the tortoise advances. But that’s ridiculous. We know it’s not true. Even with the head start, you could outrun a tortoise and you aren’t Achilles. So how can this be a paradox?</p>
</section>
<section id="can-mathematics-conquer-achilles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-mathematics-conquer-achilles">Can Mathematics Conquer Achilles?</h2>
<p>Zeno knew Achilles could catch up to the tortoise in real life, but couldn’t prove it mathematically. He thought there would be an infinite number of new points for the tortoise to reach that Achilles had to reach because he didn’t know that an infinite series of numbers could add up to a finite value. No one knew that for another 2000 years. Now we call a convergent series,</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B8%7D+%5Cdfrac%7B1%7D%7B16%7D+...%5Cinfty=1"></p>
<p>This infinite series goes on forever, but it eventually adds up to 1. And at that 1 is where, mathematically, Achilles finally reaches the tortoise. We knew that Achilles could catch up to the tortoise, but it took inventing calculus for us to prove why. This is why this paradox that confounded great minds for thousands of years is falsidical. Described by Willard Van Orman Quine like this,</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p><strong><em>A falsidical paradox packs a surprise, but it is seen as a false alarm when we solve the underlying fallacy</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>So, one paradox envelope down, and two go to go. Again, assume that behind the envelope white we have: Veridical. To understand this if we conduct a game show like this if we replace the two envelopes you’ve already opened with some prizes. How about we put a million dollars into one of them and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes"><strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong></a> <strong>(</strong><em>Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</em><strong>)</strong> in the other? The third and brown envelope still contains the term for the final type of paradox. There is a second person who is hosting the game show he/she writes 1,2,3 according to his/her preference, host shuffles these up and he/she asks you to choose the correct one and you’ll win the grand prize. After you make your selection (without switching the envelope), let’s say envelope X. The game show host reveals what’s inside one of the two remaining envelopes. It’s <strong>Sherlock Holmes</strong>. Now there are only two envelopes left: The one that you’ve chosen and the remaining mystery envelope. He gives you the option to switch your envelope.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="should-you-do-it-does-it-even-matter">Should you do it? Does it even matter?</h2>
<p>From this point of view, your odds of winning clearly 50/50. You should always switch. And here’s why. The odds of winning with your first chosen envelope are 1/3. So, you have a 33.33% repeating chance of being right and a 66.66% repeating chance of being wrong. When the game show host revealed the Sherlock, it didn’t suddenly improve your odds to 50/50. The proof is in the options. After first choosing an envelope, the thing revealed by the host will never be the money because that would ruin the tension of the game show. So, if your initial 1 out of 3 picks wasn’t the money and the money is Y, then the host will reveal Z. If you chose wrong and the money is Z, then the host reveals Y. If you luckily chose the money the first time, then the host can reveal either Z or Y. It doesn’t matter. No matter what you’re still stuck in that initial 33% chance that you chose right the very first time. If you switch, regardless of the prize revealed, you now leap into the 66% zone. You’ve doubled your chances of getting the money.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>To put it another way, when you are asked if you want to switch, you’re actually being given a dilemma: Do you want to keep your single envelope, or do you want both of the other two? It just so happens that you already know what’s inside one of them. But since the one revealed will never contain the money, the chances that the other unopened envelope has the money are twice as high as the first one that you chose.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/monty-hall-paradox-tivadar-danka/"><strong>Monty Hall Problem</strong></a> blew up after a 1990 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade_(magazine)"><strong>Parade magazine</strong></a>columnist advocated switching doors in this same scenario from the game show “Let’s make a deal”. When she told readers they should always switch to improve their odds of winning nearly about 1,000 people with PhDs wrote in to tell her that she was wrong. They were. So, the ‘Monty Hall Paradox’ is like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_paradox"><strong>Potato Paradox</strong></a>is an example of one that is a <strong>‘Veridical Paradox’</strong>, one that initially seems wrong, but is proven to be true.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p><strong><em>A veridical paradox packs surprise, but the surprise quickly dissipates itself as we ponder the proof.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>— Willard Van Orman Quine</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>There are paradoxes that seem absurd but have a perfectly good explanation, and ones that seem false and actually are false because of an underlying fallacy even if it takes a major advance in mathematics to prove it.</p>
<p>The remaining last envelope, the 3rd envelope contains the kind you think of when you think of paradoxes i.e., <strong>Antinomy. <a href="https://www.space.com/grandfather-paradox.html">The Grandfather Paradox</a></strong> is where you go back in time to kill your grandfather when he was a child but that means your father was never born so you weren’t born. So, how could you go back in time to kill your grandfather? It’s ridiculous. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/minutephysics"><strong>MinutePhysics</strong></a>proposed a solution to this but these types of paradoxes are not true or false. <strong><em>Actually, they can’t be true and they can’t be false</em>.</strong> As Willard Van Orman Quine put it, they create a crisis <strong>“Crisis in thought”.</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="i-am-lying" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-am-lying">I am Lying</h2>
<p>If I’m lying when I say that, then I must actually be telling the truth. But how can I be telling if I’m lying? The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_paradox"><strong>Liar Paradox</strong></a> is an example of Antinomy which literally means <strong>‘Against law’</strong> &amp; highlights a serious logical incompatibility.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 16px">
<p><strong><em>An antinomy packs a surprise that can be accommodate by nothing less than a repudiation of part of our conceptual heritage. — Willard Van Orman Quine</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Antinomies are paradoxes to us all. Falsidical and veridical paradoxes are only paradoxes to those who don’t know the solution, but they are still of value. Every time we resolve a scenario that runs counter to our or someone else’s initial expectations, every time we learn the how and why and share that information. We’re refining and clarifying knowledge. Which makes all three types of paradoxes excellent tools for reasoning. Whether or not something is paradoxical to an individual depends on the accuracy of their expectations. Today, modern mathematics has given us the ability to show that Zeno’s paradoxes are falsidical. But they were pure antinomy, unresolved to everyone for millennia.</p>
<div style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; font-size: 19px">
<p><strong><em>One man’s antinomy is another man’s falsidical paradox, give or take a couple of thousand years.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>— Willard Van Orman Quine</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>Who knows which antinomies of today will be solved in the future? Right now we are struggling with the paradox of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox"><strong>Faint Young Sun</strong></a>: our current knowledge of stars says that billions of years ago, our sun wasn’t hot enough to keep the Earth from being a ball of ice. But our geological evidence shows an ancient Earth with liquid oceans and budding life when everything should have been frozen. How could the Earth have liquid water without a sun hot enough to melt ice? It’s antinomy until we fully comprehend the situation. Maybe our current understanding of the sun isn’t perfect or maybe our knowledge of early Earth is missing some pieces.</p>

</div>
<p>A paradox is a problem where the solution is, or made to seem, impossible. Sometimes they’re purposely designed for fun because our minds like puzzles. Sometimes we just stumble on a gap between what we know and how we talk about what we know, and what is actually true. When we solve an impossible antinomy, it becomes falsidical or veridical. Someone who knows the answer can see what the problem was all along: We tricked ourselves by knowing too little or by asking the wrong question. In one way or another, all paradoxes come from people. By challenging us to find the flaw or fill the gap in our knowledge, paradoxes help us to define and push our intellectual boundaries. There’s always for us to know. Whether we know it or not.</p>

<p>Imagine Abhirup has an idea, and he wants to share it. There are so many ways to share an idea. He could draw a picture, make an engraving, write a song, or send a telegraph or an email. But how are these things different? And more importantly why are they the same?</p>
</div>
<section id="the-fundamental-building-blocks" class="level1">
<h1><strong>The Fundamental Building Blocks</strong></h1>
<p>This story is about a fundamental particle of all forms of communication. It begins with a special skill you likely take for granted i.e.&nbsp;<strong><em>Language</em></strong>. All language allows you to take a thought or mental object and break it down into a series of conceptual chunks. These chunks are externalized using a series of signals or symbols.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657341750354.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Humans express themselves using a variation in sound and physical action, as do chirping birds and dancing bees. And man-made machines exchange a dancing stream of electrical vibrations. Even our bodies are built according to instructions stored inside microscopic books known as DNA. All are different forms of one thing i.e.&nbsp;<strong>INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<section id="how-to-measure-information" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-measure-information"><strong>How to Measure Information</strong></h2>
<p>Information is what allows one mind to influence another. It’s based on the idea of communication as selection. Information, no matter the form, can be measured using a fundamental unit, in the same way, we can measure the mass of different objects. Using a standard measure such as kilograms or pounds. This allows us to precisely measure and compares the weight of objects. Say, rocks, water, or wheat using a scale. Information can be measured and compared using a measurement called <strong>Entropy</strong>. Think of it as an information scale. We intuitively know that a single page from some unknown book has less information than the entire book. We can describe exactly how much using a unit called a bit, a measure of surprise. So, no matter how Abhirup wants to communicate a specific message. Hieroglyphics, music, and computer code, each would contain the same number of bits, though in different densities. And a bit is linked to a very simple idea. The answer to a yes or no question. Think of it as the language of coins.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>So how is information measured? Does the information have a speed limit? A maximum density?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Information Theory holds the exciting answer to these questions. It’s an idea over 3000 years in the making. But before we can understand this, we must step back and explore perhaps the most powerful invention in human history i.e., <strong>the Alphabet</strong> and for this, we return to the cave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Informally we can think of information as some message, stored or transmitted using some medium. When you paint you are representing your message using a continuous pattern with a seemingly endless number of possible forms. You’re free to express yourself. When humans began developing writing systems, we naturally had to divide our world into a finite number of atomic units which we express using symbols. Any written language can be thought of in this way. Messages are formed by arranging symbols in specific patterns.</p>
</section>
<section id="looking-back-at-history" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="looking-back-at-history">Looking back at History</h2>
<p>Let’s return to 3000 BC and explore two ancient writing systems. First, in ancient Egypt, we had <strong>Hieroglyphics</strong>, a priestly form reserved for governmental, fiscal, magical, and religious purposes. It was practiced by select few writers known as scribes and writing was generally unintelligible to the common people.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657342968082.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="286"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The symbols themselves broadly fall into two categories namely word signs, which are symbols that represent a single meaningful concept. And sound signs represent chunks of sound. Now, the total number of different symbols in common use was over 1500 and if you divide all these symbols into word signs and vs.&nbsp;sound signs, we find a much smaller portion of sound signs. There were around 140 sound signs, and of these, only 33 represented distinct consonants, a tiny fraction of all the symbols in use. At the time, the medium used to store the symbols was primarily rock, and this was ideal for durable inscriptions, allowing messages to travel into the future. Mobility was not the main concern when communicating messages in this way. However, a new physical medium for storing symbols was emerging at the time. Along the Nile, silt deposits left from flooding made the surrounding land extremely fertile, and one of the many crops they grew was Papyrus.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657343078492.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="380"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>It could be sliced into strips and these strips were then soaked, weaved together, and finally pressed, allowing the natural sugars to act as glue. After several days, it dried and formed an almost weightless tablet. This medium was ideal for sending messages across greater spaces, rather than the more durable inscriptions focused on time. This shift towards cheap portable mediums for storing symbols coincides with the spread of writing into the hands of more people for new purposes. Gradually people began to write more on Papyrus, the symbols involved to suit rapid writing This led to a cursive script, known as Hieratic.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657343109621.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="353"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For example, here is the world’s oldest surviving surgical document. It’s written in Hieratic script, dated to around 1600 BC. These symbols were based on Hieroglyphics; however, the picture was simplified to match the swiftness of writings in ancient shorthand. Also, the number of common symbols in use began to shrink down to around 700. By escaping from the heavy medium of stone, thought gained lightness.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657343352318.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="286"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>A marked increase in writing by hand was accompanied by the secularization of writing, thoughts, and activity. This led to a new writing system called Demotic around 650 BC, which was devised specifically to facilitate the ease of rapid writing.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657343436180.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="149"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For example, this text is known as the marriage contract and is one of the earliest known examples of Demotic script. It is interesting to notice that there was a dramatic reduction again in the total number of symbols with this new system, roughly 10 percent of the total number of symbols used before. This was due to a shift towards the use of phonetic symbols, or sound signs ‘Be’, and ‘Ze’. Overword symbols, or meaning signs. And the new simplicity meant that children could be taught to write at a young age. We see this same pattern in other cultures Let’s return to 3000 BC and visit Mesopotamia, where Cuneiform was the writing system originally used for fiscal purposes, as it was a powerful method of tracking debt and surplus commodities before the invention of coins.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657343691852.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="199"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>For example, here is a document recording someone’s stock of animal hides, and this type of writing evolved to suit other needs. This tablet contains a recipe for bread and beer, and here’s another tablet given below which contains a legal document.</p>
<p>Originally, the writing system was used by the Sumerians, and there were over 2000 different symbols in use, which could also be divided into words and sound signs. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language, here is the earliest known dictionary from 2300 BC. It contains word lists in Sumerian and Akkadian, and this was discovered in modern Syria.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657343931234.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="169"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>When it was adopted by the Akkadians and fitted to their language, they reduced the number of symbols to around 600, and they did this again by moving toward sound signs. Again, we see both Hieroglyphics and Cuneiform using several hundred sound symbols in their more involved forms, and the writing system escaped their formal usage and spread to more and more people, the soil was ripe for the invention of a brand-new writing system for the people. One of the great discoveries in the history of writing dates to around 1700 BC. The Sinai inscription was found in the Sinai Peninsula, and they were about 20 feet apart.</p>
<p>This was important because each picture denotes a consonant sound, and no word signs are used. When sounded out correctly, the letters would produce words in ancient Semitic. Although not fully deciphered, this message appears to be in the form, of “name, rank, and prayer”. The two words deciphered are “Chief” and “God”.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657343968445.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="348"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This innocent example was part of a writing revolution, creating meaning by merging sound signs only. By 1000 BC, we arrive at the Phoenician Alphabet, which emerges along the Mediterranean used by the Phoenicians who are maritime trading culture.</p>
<p>The Phoenician writing system was based on the principle that one represents one consonant, and it was used to write a northern Semitic language, containing only 22 symbols in total. The symbols chosen to represent these sounds were often borrowed from Hieroglyphics pictures so that the letters’ names began with the letter’s sound. For example, mem, which stood for water, became what we know of as the letter ‘<strong>M</strong>’. Aleph, which stood for ox, became what we know of as the letter ‘<strong>A</strong>’, but the secret power of the alphabet, unknown to its inventors, was that it did not need Semitic speech to work.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://cosmic-charade.netlify.app/posts/communication-system/1657344072177.jpg" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="373"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>With modest adjustments, these miraculous letters would be fitted to diverse tongues of Europe, India, and Southeast Asia carrying literacy around the globe. This was the source of the Greek and later Roman alphabet forms we know today.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="collection-of-possible-symbols"><strong>Collection of Possible Symbols</strong></h2>
<p>The idea of an alphabet is a powerful method for transmitting and storing information. Realize, that it does not matter what the symbols are. Or how you choose them, or even what language it’s in, information is just a selection from a collection of <strong>possible symbols</strong>. And over time, we’ve always looked for faster, more efficient ways of transporting information across greater and greater spaces, and when we try doing this using new mediums, which travel faster than any human or animal, an engineering problem presents itself.</p>
