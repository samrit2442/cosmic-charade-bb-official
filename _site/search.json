Van Gogh and other impressionists represented light in a different way than their predecessors, seeming to capture its motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in starlight that twinkles and melts through milky waves of the blue night sky. The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light in the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part of our visual cortex, which sees light contrast and motion, but not color, will blend two differently colored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains‚Äô primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors without blending. With these two interpretations happening at once, the light in many impressionist works seems to pulse, flicker, and radiate oddly. That‚Äôs how this and other impressionist works use quickly executed prominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real about how light moves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\nLuminance is a photometric measure of the luminous intensity per unit area of light traveling in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through, is emitted from, or is reflected from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The candela per square meter is the unit of luminance in the International System of Units (\\(cd/m^2\\)). Here are a few examples that can help us understand the luminance values.\n\nThe luminanceLuminance of the sun.\nA filament of a clear incandescent lamp.\nFluorescent lamp.\nRoad surface under artificial lighting"

    "text": "Turbulence\n60 years later, Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) power or R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description of turbulence remains one of the unsolved problems in physics. A turbulent flow is self-similar if there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies transfer theirs to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of this include Jupiter‚Äôs Great Red Spot, cloud formations, and interstellar dust particles.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists saw the eddies of the distant cloud of dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them of Van Gogh‚Äôs ‚ÄúStarry Night‚Äù.\n\n\n\nThe illumination of interstellar dust comes from the red supergiant star at the middle of these images, which gave off a flashbulb-like pulse of light two years ago.

They discovered that there is a distinct pattern of turbulent fluid structures close to Kolmogorov‚Äôs equation hidden in many of Van Gogh‚Äôs paintings. The researchers digitized the paintings and measured how the brightness varies between any two pixels. From the curves measured for pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from Van Gogh‚Äôs period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar to fluid turbulence. His self-portrait with a pipe, from a calmer period in Van Gogh‚Äôs life, showed no sign of this correspondence. And neither did other artists‚Äô work that seemed equally turbulent at first glance, like Munch‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Scream.‚Äù While it‚Äôs too easy to say Van Gogh‚Äôs turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it‚Äôs also far too difficult to accurately express the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gough was somehow able to perceive and represent one of the most supremely difficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind‚Äôs eye with the deepest mysteries of movement, fluid, and light."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Big Bang happened 13.8 billion years ago, and the speed of light is constant, as far as we know it. Even though the universe might be infinite, the observable universe is finite. So perhaps, our universe may be just one minuscule region, in a larger multiverse.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe multiverse. One of the most baffling questions in astrophysics is ‚Äúare we a part of infinite universes?‚Äù So let‚Äôs take a look at this amazing theory of the multiverse, and do we live in one?\nBefore we go any deeper, let‚Äôs talk about some important concepts that lead us to understand the insight behind the multiverse.\n\n\nUniqueness is one of those ideas that is unquestionable. There are very low chances of something being identical to it. Just like your fingerprints. But in a very recent picture of the cosmos, which says nothing is unique, the very notion of uniqueness is being challenged. It says that there might be duplicates of everything. Not only of objects but of me, you, everyone, and everything else. And if it‚Äôs right, why haven‚Äôt we seen them? And where are they?\nThere was a time when the idea of a multiverse seemed impossible. But in recent years, scientists have discovered some compelling evidence of other universes. Some are born all the time. They might look identical to ours, having the same star and even the same planets. They might also have our duplicates, very identical to us. Except for the slightest details. In another universe, it might be possible that we would be dying or being born. We could be getting married. Or perhaps, we could even be the prime minister of India. Of course, not us per se, but our identical selves.\n\nBut how it is possible? Doesn‚Äôt this idea seem absurd?\n\nLet us take a look at why this idea is compelling, not only to us but also to the scientists.\n\n\n\nWe all know about the Big Bang theory. It tells us about the massive explosion that led to the formation of our universe. But the Big Bang misses one thing, it doesn‚Äôt tell us anything about the bang.\n\nWhat caused the bang? And how it banged?\n\nOur universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. This means that everything is moving away from each other because the space between them is expanding. In 1979, Alan Guth was studying the particles in the early universe. He observed that in the early universe, under violent and harsh environments, gravity can be repulsive. The repulsive gravity would drive apart everything around and repel it, causing a massive expansion. This force was so powerful that it could take a molecule, and blow it up to the size of a Galaxy, in less than a billionth of a blink of an eye. This idea gave birth to the theory of inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, the theory of multiverse gained unexpected support from two major areas of modern science, and these may be the key to understanding the many important phenomenons, in our universe and beyond.\n\n\n\nIn the twentieth century, astronomers believed that the universe might be shrinking, or might be slowing down. The analogy is like when you throw a ball up in the air, it comes back to you after some time. Astronomers believed that the universe was expanding and thought it would slow down. Because of the gravitational pull of the stars and galaxies. But when detailed observations were made, especially by Edwin Hubble, astronomers observed that the universe was not slowing down. Instead, it was accelerating outwards. Everything was moving away from each other at an increasing speed. Scientists believed there had to be an invisible force behind this. Astronomers called it dark energy. Dark Energy is one of the most important discoveries in astrophysics. However, there was another aspect of this strange force. Its strength. Scientists believed that at the quantum level, the amount of energy that would be generated is gigantic. When astronomers measured the amount of dark energy present in our universe it was in \\(10^{-120}\\).\nImagine a number so small, it has 119 zeros after the decimal points. That seems like an infinitely small number.\nAstronomers found out that if this tiny amount of dark energy would have been just slightly larger or lower; life as we know it wouldn‚Äôt exist.\n\nHow can this amount of dark energy be so perfect for our universe?\n\nThe multiverse gives us the answer. The amount of dark energy differs in every universe. In some,\n\n\n\n\n\nit might be so less that the matter would collapse in on itself, and hence nothing could exist. In others, dark energy is so large that matter could never get a chance to form and nothing wouldn‚Äôt even exist. And this was a baffling realization for scientists.\n\n\nAccording to¬†cosmologist Max Tegmark, there are four different levels of multiverses.

And where are they?\nThere was a time when the idea of a multiverse seemed impossible. But in recent years, scientists have discovered some compelling evidence of other universes. Some are born all the time. They might look identical to ours, having the same star and even the same planets. They might also have our duplicates, very identical to us. Except for the slightest details. In another universe, it might be possible that we would be dying or being born. We could be getting married. Or perhaps, we could even be the prime minister of India. Of course, not us per se, but our identical selves.\n\nBut how it is possible?

This means that everything is moving away from each other because the space between them is expanding. In 1979, Alan Guth was studying the particles in the early universe. He observed that in the early universe, under violent and harsh environments, gravity can be repulsive. The repulsive gravity would drive apart everything around and repel it, causing a massive expansion.

The analogy is like when you throw a ball up in the air, it comes back to you after some time. Astronomers believed that the universe was expanding and thought it would slow down. Because of the gravitational pull of the stars and galaxies. But when detailed observations were made, especially by Edwin Hubble, astronomers observed that the universe was not slowing down. Instead, it was accelerating outwards. Everything was moving away from each other at an increasing speed. Scientists believed there had to be an invisible force behind this. Astronomers called it dark energy. Dark Energy is one of the most important discoveries in astrophysics. However, there was another aspect of this strange force. Its strength. Scientists believed that at the quantum level, the amount of energy that would be generated is gigantic. When astronomers measured the amount of dark energy present in our universe it was in \\(10^{-120}\\).\nImagine a number so small, it has 119 zeros after the decimal points. That seems like an infinitely small number.\nAstronomers found out that if this tiny amount of dark energy would have been just slightly larger or lower; life as we know it wouldn‚Äôt exist.\n\nHow can this amount of dark energy be so perfect for our universe?\n\nThe multiverse gives us the answer. The amount of dark energy differs in every universe. In some,\n\n\n\n\n\nit might be so less that the matter would collapse in on itself, and hence nothing could exist. In others, dark energy is so large that matter could never get a chance to form and nothing wouldn‚Äôt even exist.

    "text": "Statistical Notations:\n\nDefining Expectation\nMany frequently used random variables can be both characterized and dealt with effectively for the practical purpose by consideration of quantities called their expectation. For example, a gambler might be interested in his average winnings at a game, a businessman in his average profit on a product, a physicist in the average charge of a particle, and so on.\nThe ‚Äòaverage‚Äô value of a random phenomenon is termed its mathematical expectation or expected value. There are several senses in which the word ‚Äúaverage‚Äù is used, but by far the most commonly used is the mean of an r.v., also known as its expected value. In addition, much of statistics is about understanding variability in the world, so it is often important to know how ‚Äúspread out‚Äù the distribution is.\n\n\nMathematical Notation:\nGiven a list of numbers \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, \\ldots, x_n\\), the familiar way to average them is to add them up and divide them by \\(n\\). This is called the Arithmetic Mean and is defined by\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_j\n\\tag{1}\\]\nMore generally, we can define a weighted mean of \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) as,\n\\[\n\\text{Weighted Mean} = \\sum_{j=1}^n x_j p_j\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere the weights \\(p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\) are pre-specified non-negative numbers that add up to 1 (so the unweighted mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) is obtained when \\(p_j = \\frac{1}{n}\\) for all \\(j\\).\nThe definition of a discrete Random Variable is inspired by the weighted mean of a list of numbers, with weights given by probabilities.\nExpectation of a discrete R.V. ‚Äî The expected value (also called the expectation or mean) of a discrete random variable \\(X\\), whose distinct possible realized values are \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots\\) is defined by\n\\[\nE(X) = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} x_j \\; P(X = x_j)\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIf the support is finite, then this is replaced by a finite sum. We can also write,\n\\[\nE(X) = \\sum_{x} \\underbrace{x}_{\\text{value}} \\; \\underbrace{P(X=x)}_{\\text{PMF at }x}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere the sum is over the support of \\(X\\) (in any case, \\(xP(X=x)\\) is \\(0\\) for any \\(x\\) not in support). The expectation is undefined if \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} |x_j| \\; P(X=x_j) = \\infty\\) , since the series for \\(E(X)\\) diverges or its value depends on the order in which the \\(x_j\\) are listed.\nIn words, the expected value of \\(X\\) is a weighted average of the possible values that \\(X\\) can take on, weighted by their probabilities. Let‚Äôs check that the definition makes sense using a simple example below.\nLet \\(X \\sim \\text{Bern}(p)\\) and \\(p = 1-q\\) then \\(E(X) = 1\\times p + 0 \\times q = p\\),\nwhich makes sense intuitively since it is between the two possible values of \\(X\\), compromising between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) based on how likely each is. This is illustrated in the figure below. For a case with \\(p&lt;\\frac{1}{2}\\) , two pebbles are being balanced on a seesaw. For the seesaw to balance, the fulcrum (shown as a triangle) must be at \\(p\\), which in physics terms is the center of mass. The frequentist interpretation would be to consider a large number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability \\(p\\) of success. Writing \\(1\\) for ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and \\(0\\) for ‚Äúfailure‚Äù, in the long run, we would expect to have data consisting of a list of numbers where the proportion of \\(1\\)‚Äôs is very close to \\(p\\). The average of a list of \\(0\\)‚Äôs and \\(1\\)‚Äôs is the proportion of \\(1\\)‚Äôs. Note that \\(E(X)\\) depends only on the distribution of \\(X\\).\nThis follows directly from the definition but is worth recording since it is fundamental.\n\n\n\n\n\nCenter of mass of two pebbles, depicting that \\(E(X)= p \\;\\; \\text{for} \\;\\;X \\sim \\text{Bern}(p)\\). Here \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) denote the masses of the two pebbles."

Everyone is quite familiar that the first two moments are useful since they provide the mean \\(E(X)\\) and the variance \\(V(X) = E \\left(X^2\\right) - \\left[E(X)\\right]^2\\), which are important summaries of the average value of \\(X\\) and how to spread out its distribution is. But there is much more to a distribution that its mean and variance. There are third and fourth moments that tell us about asymmetry of distribution and the behavior of the tails or the extreme values.\nMoments in statistics are popularly used to describe the characteristic of a distribution. It measures;\n\n\\(1^{\\text{st}} \\; \\text{Moment:}\\) Measure of location.\n\\(2^{\\text{nd}} \\; \\text{Moment:}\\) Measure of dispersion.\n\\(3^{\\text{rd}} \\; \\text{Moment:}\\) Measure of asymmetry.\n\\(4^{\\text{th}} \\; \\text{Moment:}\\) Measure of peakedness.\n\nThe \\(1^{\\text{st}}\\) order central moment which is nothing but the mean of a distribution is called Meathe sure of Central Tendency.\n\nUsual Notation of Center of Mass\nLet us consider a collection of \\(N\\) particles. Let the mass the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) particle be \\(m_i\\) and its coordinates with reference to the chosen axes be \\(x_i, y_i, z_i\\). The product \\(m_ix_i\\) for each of the particles and add them to get \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_i m_ix_i\\) , similarly, we will get \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_i m_iy_i\\) and \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_i m_iz_i\\), then\n\\[\nX = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i}m_ix_i, \\; \\;\nY = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i}m_iy_i, \\; \\;\nZ = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i}m_iz_i,\n\\tag{5}\\]\nwhere \\(M = \\sum m_i\\) is the total mass of the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, locate the point with coordinates \\((X, Y, Z)\\). This point is called the center of mass of the given collection of the particles. If the position vector of the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) particle is \\(\\vec{r_i}\\), the center of mass is defined to have the position vector\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{R_{cm}} = \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i}m_i \\vec{r_i}\n\\tag{6}\\]\nTaking \\(x,y,z\\) components of this equation, we get the coordinates of center of mass as defined in equation \\((5)\\).\nLet \\(X\\) be a random variable with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). For any positive integer \\(n\\), the \\(n^{\\text{th}}\\) moment of \\(X\\) is \\(E(X^n)\\) and the central moment is \\(E\\left[ (X-\\mu)\\right]^n\\). In particular, the mean is the firsfirst-ordertral moment and variance is the second-order central moment. The term moment is borrowed from physics. If you compare with it physics formula mean is specifically centre of mass.\nSo, let us consider \\(X\\) to be a r.v. with positive realized values \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) and imagine a pebble with mass \\(m_j=P(X=x_j)\\) positioned at \\(x_j\\) on a number line, for each \\(j\\). Therefore,\n\\[\nE(X) = \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j \\; x_j \\;\\;\\; \\text{(Center of Mass of the system)}\n\\tag{7}\\]\n\\[\nV(X) = \\sum_{j=1}^n m_j \\left[ x_j - E(X) \\right]^2 \\;\\;\\; \\text{(Moment of Inertia about center of mass)}\n\\tag{8}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysics interpretation of moments i.e., the mean (first moment) of an R.V. corresponds to the center of mass of a collection of pebbles, and the variance (second central moment) corresponds to the moment of inertia about the center of mass.\nThis mathematical formula holds for continuous cases also. Because if summation notation defines discrete case then there might be the continuous case which is true.\n\n\nCenter of Mass for Continuous Bodies\nIf we consider the body to have a continuous distribution of matter, the summation in the formula of the center of mass should be replaced by integration. So, we don‚Äôt talk of the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) particle, rather we talk of a small element of the body having a mass \\(dm\\), we denote the coordinates of the centre of mass as\n\\[\nX = \\dfrac{1}{M} \\int xdm\\ ,\\ Y = \\dfrac{1}{M}\\int ydm\\ ,\\ Z = \\dfrac{1}{M}\\int zdm\n\\]\nThe integration is to be performed under the proper limits so that as the integration variable goes through the limits, the elements cover the entire body.\nThis is the absolute beauty of moments. Mathematics has a beginning but there is no end. It is just like an expanding universe because both have no boundaries and don‚Äôt allow perfection. It is the only place where truth and beauty bring revolution.\n\n\nReferences\n\nIntroduction to Probability by Jessica Hwang and Joseph K. Blitzstein.\nFundamentals of Mathematical Statistics by S.

    "text": "The Science of Tuning\nMany musical instruments, including pianos, guitars, and violins, make a sound when strings are plucked, hit, or set in vibration in some other way. When you pluck a string, it vibrates at a certain frequency according to its length and tension, and these vibrations are sensed by the ear and relayed to the brain. If you pluck a bunch of strings together, it can either sound nice or downright awful, depending upon the frequency relationships among the strings.¬†\nA guitarist may play an open string, say G, and then place a finger on a fret to create a sound with a higher pitch, say G#, A, or B. What is happening is that the player is shortening the vibrating part of the string to produce a higher pitch. This is based on the fundamental fact that shorter (skinner or tighter) strings produce higher pitches. Similar facts are true with woodwind, percussion, and other types of instruments in general: the smaller the vibrating portion gets, the higher the sound becomes. That is why, for instance, a tuba is bigger than a French horn, and a Contrabass Flute is longer than a Soprano Flute."

    "section": "Brief Explanation",
    "text": "Brief Explanation\nSuppose we pluck a string of a certain length and create a wave, a vibration of the air. The string will move up and down in oscillation. Each wave, whether it is a simple water wave, sound, earthquake, radio wave, microwave, or light wave, has a frequency, which measures how many times the oscillation occurs in a given time period, such as one second. For sound, the frequency is measured in ‚Äúcycles per second‚Äù¬†(abbreviated ‚Äúcps‚Äù), sometimes called ‚Äúhertz‚Äù (denoted ‚ÄúHz‚Äù). Frequency is what determines the pitch of the sound generated by the vibration.¬†\nWhen a string is plucked and set in motion, the entire string vibrates, as shown in the picture above. The frequency created by the whole string is referred to as the ‚Äúfundamental frequency‚Äù of the string. It generates the lowest sound the string can possibly make. This is equivalent to playing an open string on the guitar. If the guitar is tuned in the standard way, the sixth string (the thickest one, located on the top) is the E string, meaning that its fundamental frequency corresponds to the pitch we call an ‚ÄúE‚Äù. This is the lowest sound a guitar can play.\nNow, if we take that same string, press the midpoint of it, and pluck it, only half of the string would vibrate, shortening the wavelength to half and doubling the frequency. This, of course, results in a higher pitch. But how much higher? When the frequency is doubled, we call the interval between those two pitches an ‚Äúoctave‚Äù (meaning 8). For instance, if the open string has a frequency of 440 cps, then the half string would have a frequency of 880 cps, and that sound is called an octave higher than the first. One can, of course, keep making the vibrating portion shorter and shorter to create higher and higher sounds."

    "text": "Pythagoras: Numbers, Music, and Harmony\nMusic has existed in different cultures for millennia, but it was Pythagoras, an ancient Greek mathematician, and philosopher, who explicitly linked sound (pitch) with frequency (number), laying a foundation of music theory based on mathematics. It was known to Pythagoras that two notes (sounds with different frequencies) sound nice together (harmonious, pleasant) when the ratio of the two frequencies is a simple fraction. For instance, two pitches that are an octave apart have a ratio of 2 to 1, as described above. 2/1 (or its reciprocal ¬Ω) is a simple fraction, and these two notes sound nice if played simultaneously. In fact, if two people sing a song one octave apart, it could sound almost like unison. These simple fractions give rise to well-known interval names in music theory:\n\\[\\ 2.00 : Octave\\\\\n  \\  \\dfrac{5}{3} = 1.666...\\ : Major \\ sixth \\\\\n   \\dfrac{3}{2} = 1.50 \\ :\\ Perfect \\ fifth \\\\\n    \\dfrac{4}{3} = 1.333... \\ : \\ Perfect \\ fourth\\\\\n     \\dfrac{5}{4} = 1.25 \\ : \\ Major \\ third  \\]\nPythagoras Once Said,\n\n‚ÄúThere is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese simple ratios became a foundation for various musical scales and musical chords. For this reason, sometimes Pythagoras is called the father of music theory. In fact, as a religious and philosophical leader, he taught that ratios create harmony, which forms beauty in nature; therefore, ratios are divine. His followers, called the Pythagoreans, thus did not believe in the existence of numbers that were not ratios of integers. It is then quite ironic that Pythagoras himself later proved that the square root of 2 (the length of the hypotenuse of a right isosceles triangle whose two sides are 1 unit long) is irrational, contradicting his own teaching that every number is rational. (By the way, this number, 2, came about by a theorem named after him‚Äîthe Pythagorean Theorem!) Regardless of this devastating discovery, numerical ratios played a very significant role in the composition of musical scales.\nThroughout history, there have been many musical scales in various cultures, traditions, genres, and generations. Many authors have documented a wide variety of scales and methods of tuning instruments. Interested readers can look up topics such as Pythagorean tuning, and Meantone temperament."

    "text": "Method of Fluxions\nBayes‚Äôs conclusions were accepted by Laplace in a 1781, rediscovered by Condorcet (as Laplace mentions), and remained unchallenged until Boole questioned them in the Laws of Thought. Since then, Bayes‚Äô techniques have been subject to controversy.Bayes also wrote an article ‚ÄúAn Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of The Analyst (1736)‚Äú,attacking Berkeley for his attack on the logical foundations of the calculus. In the Preface Bayes gives his reasons for writing the text:\n\nI have long ago thought that the first principles and rules of the method of Fluxions stood in need of more full and distinct explanation and proof, than what they had received either from their first incomparable author, or any of his followers; and therefore was not at all displeased to find the method itself opposed with so much warmth by the ingenious author of the Analyst; and had it been his only design to bring this point to a fair issue, whether a demonstration by the method of Fluxions be truly scientific or not, I should have heartily applauded his conduct, and have thought he deserved the thanks even of the Mathematicians themselves. But the invidious light in which he has put this debate, by representing it as of consequence to the interests of religion, is, I think, truly unjustifiable, as well as highly imprudent.\n\nBayes writes that Berkeley:\n...represents the disputes and controversies among mathematicians as disparaging the evidence of their methods: and ... he represents Logics and Metaphysics as proper to open their eyes, and extricate them from their difficulties. ... If the disputes of the professors of any science disparage the science itself, Logics and Metaphysics are much more disparaged than Mathematics, why, therefore, if I am half blind, must I take for my guide one that can‚Äôt see at all?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few other pieces of mathematics which have come down to us from Bayes. A notebook which was almost certainly written by Bayes is examined in detail. This notebook contains a considerable amount of mathematical work, including discussions of probability, trigonometry, geometry, solution of equations, series and differential calculus. There are also sections on natural philosophy in which Bayes looks at topics which include electricity, optics and celestial mechanics."

    "section": "",
    "text": "‚ÄúMusic is the pleasure that human soul experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting‚Äù‚Äî Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716).\n\nOne of the aspects of music that is based on tradition is which frequencies of sound may be used for ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô notes. The concept of the octave, where one note is twice the frequency of another is almost universal, but the number of other notes that may be found between is highly variable from one culture to another, as is the tuning of those notes.\nIn the western European tradition, there are twelve scale degrees, which are generally used in one or two assortments of seven. For the past hundred and fifty years or so, the tuning of these notes have been standardized as dividing the octave into twelve equal steps. The western equal tempered scale can then be defined as a series built by multiplying the last member by the twelfth root of two (1.05946). The distance between two notes is known by the musical term interval. (Frequency specifications are not very useful when we are talking about notes.) The smallest interval is the half step, which can be further broken down into one hundred units called cents.\n\nExponential Function vs Log Function\nAn exponential function is of the form \\(y = b^x\\) . As you can see \\(y\\) rises very rapidly for positive values of \\(x\\) , and decays slowly for negative values of \\(x\\) .\n\n\n\n\n\nMany things in nature exhibit either exponential growth or decay; so one often describes their dynamics with an exponential relationship such as \\(y(t) = b^{ct}\\) where the value \\(c\\) determines how fast things grow or decay depending on \\(c\\) is positive or negative respectively.A logarithm is basically the inverse of the\n\n\n\n\n\nexponential function. Thus \\(\\log_bx\\) means the exponential to which you should raise \\(b\\) in order to obtain the number \\(x\\). In other words, we are asking \\(b^{?}\\). The number \\(b\\) is known as base of the logarithm.You\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should confirm by comparison, that it is just the inverse of the exponential function i.e., it‚Äôs the same function, just flipped on its side.\n\n\nSound Intensity ‚Äî The Decibel Scale\nAlexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, observed that the difference in sound intensity that was needed to produce a perceptible change in the loudness of two tones increases proportional to the absolute intensity of the reference tone. That is, if you are comparing two very soft tones, then only a small change in intensity is need to perceive a difference. But if you are comparing two loud tones, then a larger change in intensity is needed to perceive the difference. Importantly, he found that the ratio of the intensities of the two tones needed to produce a perceptible difference was more or less constant, irrespective of the absolute intensity level one is at.\nThe ‚Äòbel‚Äô scale was named in Bell‚Äôs honor. It is just the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of intensity (power) of two sounds \\[difference\\ in\\ decibels = \\log_{10}\\bigg(\\dfrac{p_1}{p_2}\\bigg) \\]\nwhere \\(p_1\\) is the intensity of one sound and \\(p_2\\) is the intensity of other. Thus a difference of \\(5\\) bels means that the ratio of sound intensities is \\(100,000\\). A ‚Äòdecibel‚Äô is simply \\(\\dfrac{1}{10}\\) of a bel, and is denoted by db. Thus, a difference of 5 bels is the same as a difference of 50 decibels. Oftentimes the quantity one measures in an experiment is amplitude (for example, the amplitude of air pressure variations), and since power (what we have been loosely calling intensity) is proportional to the square of the amplitude, we have,\n\\[\ndifference\\ in\\ decibels = \\log_{10}\\bigg(\\dfrac{a_1}{a_2}\\bigg)^2\n\\] where \\(a_1\\) is the amplitude of one sound and \\(a_2\\) is the amplitude of other.\n\n\nMusic\nPerhaps one of the most interesting questions about music perception is why some intervals sound pleasing (consonant) and others sound harsh or difficult to bear (dissonant)?\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the consonant intervals all have integer-fraction frequency ratios. The consequence of this is that their harmonics will tend to either align or else produce other consonant frequency ratios. For example, the second harmonic \\(G\\) will be \\(2\\bigg(\\dfrac{3}{2}\\bigg)=3\\) times of the fundamental \\(C\\) . Thus, the second harmonic of G exactly aligns with the third harmonic of C. But this still doesn‚Äôt answer all of our questions. What if we were to just play two pure tones that don‚Äôt have any harmonics. We still get dissonance when they are next to each other in frequency. Why? The answer seems to be that it has something to do with critical bandwidth‚Äìi.e., the region over which frequencies significantly interact within a nerve fiber, which is about \\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\) octave. The degree of perceived consonance between two tones depends on their relation to the critical bandwidth. If they are further apart than the critical bandwidth, then they are perceived to be consonant, but if within the critical bandwidth they are perceived dissonant. Of course, as the two tones become even closer to one another they again become consonant. Thus, there seems to be a relation between dissonance and the bandwidth of frequency-tuned mechanisms in the cochlea and auditory nerve, but what interactions occur exactly that give rise to the percept of dissonance, and how this is processed and represented by the nervous system, is currently unknown.\n\n\nThe Modern Piano and Mathematics\nThe modern piano has been designed to have an equally-tempered scale, meaning that the ratio between the frequencies of any two adjacent notes‚Äîfor example, C to C# is (approximately) the same no matter where you go on the keyboard. Thus, musical instruments have been designed around the logarithmic representation of frequency in the nervous system. Thus, a logarithmic scale provides a natural, intuitive way to describe sound intensity, because equal ratios, or equally discriminable sound levels, are converted to equal differences or intervals on the log-scale. Logarithmic scales provide a useful way to describe many types of natural phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\nA lot of pianos look like an exponential because for waves on a string, doubling length means reducing a music pitch by an octave (2x the frequency). The ‚ÄúStretched Harmonics‚Äù of a plain steel wire string produces an inharmonicity of pitch values produced by the High Tension (~200lbs.) on piano strings. This is why pianos have the ‚ÄúChime like‚Äù sound of tone color rather than other stringed instruments which have lower string tension. (35-50lbs.). Eg. Nylon string classical guitar has a harmonic sonority close to a mathematical harmonic series.\nPiano tones, though, are stretched by a geometric factor of ‚Äú~1.1x‚Äù because of the physical high tension in the wire, and have that ‚ÄôBell Like‚Äù set of partials.\nThe tuning of piano by some professionals of piano keys will blend with each other, and are slightly higher (by an epsilon fraction) than a 2x doubling in octave frequency.\n\n\nReference\n\nInharmonicity of Plain Wire Piano String\nThe Importance of Music Theory"

We could possibly live in a universe that is superior to our own in some ways if particles, fields, or even individuals could be transported from one to the other. These ideas have a foothold in theoretical physics as well, from the myriad of possible outcomes from quantum mechanics as well as ideas of the multiverse. Parallel universes are one of those intriguing ideas that sound imaginative but are very difficult to test. After all, we‚Äôre stuck in our own universe, and maybe there‚Äôs no way to test this idea about parallel universes. Because in all the experiments that scientists have ever performed, they‚Äôve never found any strange interactions that require something outside of the governing physics to explain. For example, particles don‚Äôt simply appear, disappear, or transform. They can only interact with other quanta of matter and energy. We live in a universe that is governed by the law of physics. So, every interaction of particles must be uniformly governed by the same law.\nThere‚Äôs actually a link between this example and the media hype on the evidence of parallel universes. It appears that the claim about the evidence for parallel universes started from an article posted by New Scientist.\nIn all fairness, the post is backed up by a thought-provoking article about some puzzling results from an experiment conducted in Antarctica. So before we go any deeper, let‚Äôs first understand how the whole experiment works.\nIn all fairness, the post is backed up by a thought-provoking article about some puzzling results from an experiment conducted in Antarctica.

    "text": "Helium Balloon Experiment and ANITA\nThe Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) conducted a long-term helium balloon experiment. It is designed to detect radio signals generated by ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays. This helium balloon is flying over Antarctica, at a height of thirty-seven thousand meters.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutrinos, which are subatomic particles similar to electrons, have no electrical charge and are sometimes considered massless. These particles are abundant in the universe, and they are very hard to detect. Even now, scientists have estimated that millions of neutrinos are passing through every square centimetre of our skin, without leaving any clue. The main source of Neutrinos are stars and in our case, it is the Sun.\nBut when a very high energy neutrino particle passes through matter, they do interact with the matter and their interaction generates radio waves. If we can detect these radio waves, we can tell what kind of neutrino interaction it was, and through the direction of those radio waves, we can find where those neutrinos were coming from.\nIn 2016, ANITA made a very strange discovery. Usually, when neutrinos are detected, they come from outer space, because that is where the source lies. But, during ANITA‚Äôs flight in 2016, it detected Neutrinos that were not coming from space. Instead, it was coming from Earth. A neutrino can pass through Earth without interacting with it, but when it comes to high-energy neutrinos, they do interact with matter. During their collision with atoms, they produce some particles and radio waves. So, if highly energetic neutrinos do pass through the earth, they would interact with the Earth and generate radio waves. But the problem was that ANITA couldn‚Äôt detect those radio waves.\nIn Antarctica, where the ANITA experiment is being performed there is also another experimental setup that can detect neutrinos coming from the earth. This experimental setup is known as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory run by CERN. If some high-energy neutrinos pass through the earth, they can be detected through this observatory. But ANITA‚Äôs detection of these neutrinos the ground-based experimental setup didn‚Äôt detect any of them. This is impossible as far as scientists think but the helium balloon did this.\n\nHow can some neutrinos pass through the Earth and reach ANITA without being noticed by IceCube observatory?\n\nEven if we ignore this, then one of the possibilities is that there is some neutrino source on the other side of the earth, and it could be that these neutrinos came from that source. However, scientists believe that this hypothesis is incorrect. Because no known source can emit lots of high-energy neutrinos, which can pass through the earth and be detected through ANITA."

In this mirror world, positive is negative, left is right and time runs backward.‚Äù\n\nIf that kind of universe does exist, which is dominated by anti-matter and somehow connected to ours, then that behavior of Neutrinos can be explained as moving backward in time. But when the scientists checked out all the data and did some math on it, it made the least possible explanation for the strange behavior of neutrinos.\nLooking at the bigger picture, the problems facing the picture of our universe are not limited to what humans can perceive. The advancement of science, our mind, and our thinking condition the way we explore the universe and because of this, it may be that we have some kind of blind spot for the cosmic phenomena that run counter to human intuition and understanding.\n\n‚ÄúThe Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.‚Äù ~ Neil deGrasse Tyson\n\nThe idea of a parallel universe is super exciting.

    "text": "Indian Astronomy\nIndian astronomy has a long history. Some of the earliest roots of Indian astronomy can be dated to the period of Indus Valley civilization or earlier. Ancient Indian astronomy may be classified into two main categories:\n\nThe Vedic Astronomy\nThe post Vedic Astronomy\n\nThe vedic astronomy is the astronomy of the vedic period i.e.¬†the astronomy found in the vedic Sa·πÉhitas and Brahmans and allied literature. The principal avocation of the people in the vedic times being the performance of the vedic sacrifices at the times prescribed by the ≈õastras, it was necessary to have accurate knowledge of the science of time so that the times prescribed for performing the various vedic sacrifices could be correctly predicted well in advance. Astronomy in those times, therefore, was essentially the science of time-determination. It centred round the Sun and Moon and its aim was to study the natural divisions of time caused by the motion of the Sun and Moon, such as days, months, seasons and years, special attention being paid to the study of the times of occurrence of new moons, full moons, equinoxes and solstices.\nThe Rigveda shows that the Indians divided the year into 360 days, and the year was subdivided into 12 months of 30 days. Every 5 years, two intercalary periods were added to bring the calendar back in line with the solar year, ensuring that years averaged 366 days. However, the Indian year still migrated four days in every five years, and Indian astronomers constantly tweaked and adjusted their calendars over the millennia. The text also shows that the Indians used four cardinal points for ensuring the correct orientation of altars.\nThe Jyotisa Vedanga, the first Vedic text to mention astronomical data, records events going back as far as 4000 BCE, although many archaeoastronomers believe that this text may include observations from as early as 11,000 BCE. They point out that some of the records may have been copied from earlier manuscripts, but this is an area where more research is needed, as many of the references are unclear and couched in religious terminology.\nThe first proper astronomy began in the 5th century. Indian astronomer Aryabhata began to adopt a more rigorous, mathematical approach to astronomy. Aryabhata added to the heliocentric theory, proposing the idea that the moon reflects the light of the sun, a theory also proposed by some Greeks but not widely adopted. His book, the ‚ÄòAryabhatiya,‚Äô was translated into Latin in the 13th Century. This work gave the Europeans some methods for measuring the volume of spheres and the area of triangles, as well as methods for calculating square roots and cube roots. He also calculated the length of a sidereal day (23 hours , 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds). Aryabhata is known as father of ancient Indian astronomy.\nBhaskara-II from 12th century worked on both mathematics and astronomy . He had done a vast research on sun, moon, stars and other planets. He wrote a scripture named ‚ÄúSiddhanta Siromani‚Äù. There he discussed about math and astronomy."

    "title": "An All-Consuming Monster",
    "section": "Introducing Black Hole",
    "text": "Introducing Black Hole\nThe idea of the existence of a black hole was first proposed in the 18th century. This idea was proposed based on the only known gravitational laws. An English physician named John Michell published a paper in 1784 in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (Vol. 84, p.¬†35), with the rather rambling title ‚ÄôOn the Means of Discovering the Distance, Magnitude, etc. of the Fixed Stars, in Consequence of the Diminution of the velocity of the Light in the case of such a Diminution should be found to take place in any one of them, and such other Data should be Procured from Observations, as would be Further Necessary for that Purpose. In this paper, Michell discussed stars in general and speculated about the possibility of astronomical objects whose mass and radius satisfy the criteria for a black hole. Meanwhile, Michell wanted to explain that if an object has enough small size and mass enough, it is impossible for anything to escape its gravitational force. Even light can be stuck forever.\nThis same idea struck the French Mathematician Marquis de Laplace. He expressed the idea in his book ‚ÄòThe System Of The World‚Äô. Laplace had carried out exhaustive research on Newtonian gravity and conceived of the notion of such an object in the year 1799. It is clear from his discussion that his concept implied the property of the escape speed exceeding the speed of light.‚ÄôEscape speed‚Äô is defined as the minimum speed with which a particle is to be ejected from the object in order that it never returns to the object. For the Earth, this speed works out as \\(11.2\\) kilometers per hour. Although Laplace or Michell did not use the term ‚Äòblack hole‚Äô to describe these objects. Laplace‚Äôs work was based on the Newtonian theory of gravitation. Today when we discuss strong gravitational effects, we found that the Newtonian framework is questionable and we prefer to use Einstein‚Äôs general theory of relativity. It was Dr.¬†John Archibald Wheeler, a visionary physicist who coined the term ‚ÄòBlack Hole,‚Äô at a conference in New York in 1967.\nAlbert Einstein first predicted the existence of black holes in 1916, with his general theory of relativity. Karl Schwarzschild developed the idea of black holes from relativity‚Äôs equations in 1916, just a year after Einstein published his theory. Schwarzschild‚Äôs solution identified a radius for any given mass, known as the Schwarzschild radius, where, if that mass could be compressed to fit within that radius, no known force or degeneracy pressure could stop it from continuing to collapse into a gravitational singularity or black hole. Thus, where the radius of the body is less than its Schwarzschild radius, everything, even photons of light, must inevitably fall into the central body. As a corollary, when the mass density of this central body exceeds a particular limit, it triggers a gravitational collapse to what is known as a Schwarzschild black hole, a non-charged, non-rotating black hole.\nAfter decades of black holes being known only as theoretical objects. Around the 1930s J. Robert Oppenheimer, Volkoff and Snyder pondered the possibility of such objects in the universe. Later, these three scientists proved that, when a sufficiently competent star has lost all its fuel, it has no nuclear reaction to external pressure. As a result, the star begins to collapse under the influence of its own gravitational force. And this is how the idea of black holes was developed."

The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the mouth of the black hole, past which light cannot escape. Once a particle crosses the event horizon, it cannot leave. Gravity is constant across the event horizon. The inner region of a black hole, where the object‚Äôs mass lies, is known as its singularity, the single point in space-time where the mass of the black hole is concentrated. Scientists can‚Äôt see black holes the way they can see stars and other objects in space. Instead, astronomers must rely on detecting the radiation black holes emit as dust and gas are drawn into the dense creatures. But supermassive black holes, lying in the center of a galaxy, may become shrouded by the thick dust and gas around them, which can block the tell-tale emissions.\n\n\n\nESO‚Äôs black hole anatomy diagram shows what a black hole looks like and labels the different components.

For smaller stars (those up to about three times the sun‚Äôs mass), the new core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress and creates a stellar black hole.\n\n\nSupermassive Black Holes:\nSmall black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, super-massive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as massive as the sun but are about the same size in diameter. Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way. Supermassive black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge.\n\n\nIntermediate Black Holes:\nScientists once thought that black holes came in only small and large sizes, but research has revealed the possibility that midsize, or intermediate, black holes (IMBHs) could exist. Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction. Several of these IMBHs forming in the same region could then eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a supermassive black hole. In 2014, astronomers found what appeared to be an intermediate-mass black hole in the arm of a spiral galaxy."

First up‚ÄîWhat is it exactly?\nGravitational lensing occurs when a huge amount of matter, like a cluster of galaxies, creates a gravitational field that distorts and magnifies the light from distant galaxies that are behind it but in the same line of sight. The effect is like looking through a giant magnifying glass.\nThe first gravitational lens was discovered in 1979, when two¬†quasars were discovered very close to each other in the sky and with similar distances and spectra. The two quasars were actually the same object whose light had been split into two paths by the gravitational influence of an intervening galaxy.\nSmaller objects, like individual stars, can also act as gravitational lenses when they pass in front of more distant stars. For a few days or weeks, light from the more distant star temporarily appears brighter because it is magnified by the gravity of the closer object, a phenomenon known as gravitational microlensing.\nThe significance of Gravitational Lensing¬†is that it probes the distribution of matter in galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and enables observations of the distant universe. Strong gravitational lensing allows us to improve the angular resolution of current and future telescopes and eliminates the need for absolute astrometry. Gravitational lenses induce time delays and produce multiple images of sources.\nGravitational lensing not only distorts the image of a background galaxy, it can amplify its light. For example, looking through a lensing galaxy cluster, The Hubble Space Telescope can see fainter and more distant galaxies than otherwise possible.\nAngular Einstein Radius gives us an appropriate scale for the angular deflection expected from a given lens:\n\\[\n\\theta_E = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{4GM}{c^2} \\dfrac{D_{LS}}{D_L D_S}}\n\\]\n\\(G= \\text{Universal Gravitational Constant}\\)\n\\(M = \\text{Mass of spherically symmetric lens}\\)\n\\(c= \\text{Velocity of light in vacuum}\\)\n\\(D_L = \\text{Angular Diameter Distance of lens from observer}\\)\n\\(D_S = \\text{Angular Diameter Distance of source from observer}\\)\n\\(D_{LS} = \\text{Angular Diameter Distance between the two}\\)\nIf the lens is roughly halfway to the source, then the Einstein radius (which, is in radians and thus dimensionless) is approximately the square root of the ratio of the Schwarzschild radius \\((R = \\dfrac{2GM}{c^2} ; \\; \\text{this is the radius of a non-spinning black hole with mass } M)\\) to the distance the lens."

    "text": "Observations:\n\nGiant Luminous Arcs: This phenomenon was first discovered in 1986 by Lynds and Petrosian: magnified, distorted and strongly elongated images of background galaxies which happened to lie behind foreground clusters of galaxies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiply-imaged quasars: In 1979, the double quasar ‚ÄòQ0957+561‚Äô was discovered through Gravitational Lensing. Initially, it was unclear whether there were two quasars really present or whether it was simply an optical illusion. But intensive observations soon confirmed the almost identical spectra. The intervening ‚Äúlensing‚Äù galaxy was found, and the ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù cluster was identified as well. Later very similar light curves of the two images confirmed this system beyond any doubt as a bonafide gravitational lens.\n\n\n\n\nThe Double-Quasar ‚ÄòQ0957+561‚Äô\n\n\n\nEinstein rings: The simplest type of gravitational lensing occurs when there is a single concentration of matter at the center, such as the dense core of a galaxy. The light of a distant galaxy is redirected around this core, often producing multiple images of the background galaxy. When the lensing approaches perfect symmetry, a complete or almost-complete circle of light is produced, called an Einstein ring. Hubble observations have helped to greatly increase the number of Einstein rings known to astronomers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Matter: The lensed images also act as probes of the matter distribution in the galaxy cluster. The results indicate that most of the matter in a galaxy cluster is not in the visible galaxies or hot gas around them and does not emit light, and is thus called dark matter. The distribution of lensed images reflects the distribution of all matter, both visible and dark. Hubble‚Äôs images of gravitational lensing have been used to create maps of dark matter in galaxy clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEinstein worked out the equations for his general theory of relativity and realized that massive objects caused a distortion in space-time.\nImagine setting a large object in the center of a trampoline. The object would press down into the fabric, causing it to dimple. If you then attempt to roll a marble around the edge of the trampoline, the marble would spiral inward toward the body, pulled in much the same way that the gravity of a planet pulls at rocks in space.\nAccording to Einstein‚Äôs general theory of relativity, time and space are fused together in a quantity known as spacetime. Within this theory, massive objects cause spacetime to curve, and gravity is simply the curvature of spacetime. Light bends around a massive object, such as a black hole, causing it to act as a lens for the things that lie behind it.\nFundamentally, it just acts like classical geometric optics. Curved spacetime causes light bundles to deflect, and also to shear and expand. The result is that a background light source can have its apparent position, shape, and flux changed by a foreground gravitational lens.\nThe surface brightness of a lensed object, however, is not changed, because the light goes from flat spacetime to flat spacetime after going through the lens, and the surface brightness is altered only by red shifts.\n\nLight is neither created nor destroyed by lensing, just redistributed‚Ä¶"

    "text": "How to Measure Information\nInformation is what allows one mind to influence another. It‚Äôs based on the idea of communication as selection. Information, no matter the form, can be measured using a fundamental unit, in the same way, we can measure the mass of different objects. Using a standard measure such as kilograms or pounds. This allows us to precisely measure and compares the weight of objects. Say, rocks, water, or wheat using a scale. Information can be measured and compared using a measurement called Entropy. Think of it as an information scale. We intuitively know that a single page from some unknown book has less information than the entire book. We can describe exactly how much using a unit called a bit, a measure of surprise. So, no matter how Abhirup wants to communicate a specific message. Hieroglyphics, music, and computer code, each would contain the same number of bits, though in different densities. And a bit is linked to a very simple idea. The answer to a yes or no question. Think of it as the language of coins.\n\nSo how is information measured? Does the information have a speed limit? A maximum density?¬†\n\nInformation Theory holds the exciting answer to these questions. It‚Äôs an idea over 3000 years in the making. But before we can understand this, we must step back and explore perhaps the most powerful invention in human history i.e., the Alphabet and for this, we return to the cave.¬†\nInformally we can think of information as some message, stored or transmitted using some medium. When you paint you are representing your message using a continuous pattern with a seemingly endless number of possible forms. You‚Äôre free to express yourself. When humans began developing writing systems, we naturally had to divide our world into a finite number of atomic units which we express using symbols. Any written language can be thought of in this way. Messages are formed by arranging symbols in specific patterns."

    "section": "Looking back at History",
    "text": "Looking back at History\nLet‚Äôs return to 3000 BC and explore two ancient writing systems. First, in ancient Egypt, we had Hieroglyphics, a priestly form reserved for governmental, fiscal, magical, and religious purposes. It was practiced by select few writers known as scribes and writing was generally unintelligible to the common people.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nThe symbols themselves broadly fall into two categories namely word signs, which are symbols that represent a single meaningful concept. And sound signs represent chunks of sound. Now, the total number of different symbols in common use was over 1500 and if you divide all these symbols into word signs and vs.¬†sound signs, we find a much smaller portion of sound signs. There were around 140 sound signs, and of these, only 33 represented distinct consonants, a tiny fraction of all the symbols in use. At the time, the medium used to store the symbols was primarily rock, and this was ideal for durable inscriptions, allowing messages to travel into the future. Mobility was not the main concern when communicating messages in this way. However, a new physical medium for storing symbols was emerging at the time. Along the Nile, silt deposits left from flooding made the surrounding land extremely fertile, and one of the many crops they grew was Papyrus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt could be sliced into strips and these strips were then soaked, weaved together, and finally pressed, allowing the natural sugars to act as glue. After several days, it dried and formed an almost weightless tablet. This medium was ideal for sending messages across greater spaces, rather than the more durable inscriptions focused on time. This shift towards cheap portable mediums for storing symbols coincides with the spread of writing into the hands of more people for new purposes. Gradually people began to write more on Papyrus, the symbols involved to suit rapid writing This led to a cursive script, known as Hieratic.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, here is the world‚Äôs oldest surviving surgical document. It‚Äôs written in Hieratic script, dated to around 1600 BC. These symbols were based on Hieroglyphics; however, the picture was simplified to match the swiftness of writings in ancient shorthand. Also, the number of common symbols in use began to shrink down to around 700. By escaping from the heavy medium of stone, thought gained lightness.\n\n\n\n\n\nA marked increase in writing by hand was accompanied by the secularization of writing, thoughts, and activity. This led to a new writing system called Demotic around 650 BC, which was devised specifically to facilitate the ease of rapid writing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, this text is known as the marriage contract and is one of the earliest known examples of Demotic script. It is interesting to notice that there was a dramatic reduction again in the total number of symbols with this new system, roughly 10 percent of the total number of symbols used before. This was due to a shift towards the use of phonetic symbols, or sound signs ‚ÄòBe‚Äô, and ‚ÄòZe‚Äô. Overword symbols, or meaning signs. And the new simplicity meant that children could be taught to write at a young age. We see this same pattern in other cultures Let‚Äôs return to 3000 BC and visit Mesopotamia, where Cuneiform was the writing system originally used for fiscal purposes, as it was a powerful method of tracking debt and surplus commodities before the invention of coins.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, here is a document recording someone‚Äôs stock of animal hides, and this type of writing evolved to suit other needs. This tablet contains a recipe for bread and beer, and here‚Äôs another tablet given below which contains a legal document.\nOriginally, the writing system was used by the Sumerians, and there were over 2000 different symbols in use, which could also be divided into words and sound signs. Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language, here is the earliest known dictionary from 2300 BC. It contains word lists in Sumerian and Akkadian, and this was discovered in modern Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it was adopted by the Akkadians and fitted to their language, they reduced the number of symbols to around 600, and they did this again by moving toward sound signs. Again, we see both Hieroglyphics and Cuneiform using several hundred sound symbols in their more involved forms, and the writing system escaped their formal usage and spread to more and more people, the soil was ripe for the invention of a brand-new writing system for the people. One of the great discoveries in the history of writing dates to around 1700 BC. The Sinai inscription was found in the Sinai Peninsula, and they were about 20 feet apart.\nThis was important because each picture denotes a consonant sound, and no word signs are used. When sounded out correctly, the letters would produce words in ancient Semitic. Although not fully deciphered, this message appears to be in the form, of ‚Äúname, rank, and prayer‚Äù. The two words deciphered are ‚ÄúChief‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis innocent example was part of a writing revolution, creating meaning by merging sound signs only. By 1000 BC, we arrive at the Phoenician Alphabet, which emerges along the Mediterranean used by the Phoenicians who are maritime trading culture.\nThe Phoenician writing system was based on the principle that one represents one consonant, and it was used to write a northern Semitic language, containing only 22 symbols in total. The symbols chosen to represent these sounds were often borrowed from Hieroglyphics pictures so that the letters‚Äô names began with the letter‚Äôs sound. For example, mem, which stood for water, became what we know of as the letter ‚ÄòM‚Äô. Aleph, which stood for ox, became what we know of as the letter ‚ÄòA‚Äô, but the secret power of the alphabet, unknown to its inventors, was that it did not need Semitic speech to work.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith modest adjustments, these miraculous letters would be fitted to diverse tongues of Europe, India, and Southeast Asia carrying literacy around the globe. This was the source of the Greek and later Roman alphabet forms we know today."

Or how you choose them, or even what language it‚Äôs in, information is just a selection from a collection of possible symbols. And over time, we‚Äôve always looked for faster, more efficient ways of transporting information across greater and greater spaces, and when we try doing this using new mediums, which travel faster than any human or animal, an engineering problem presents itself."

Feld in 1991 paper in the American Journal of Sociology entitled ‚ÄúWhy Your Friends Have More Friends Than You Do‚Äù. The simplest way to think of the friendship paradox is as a form of sampling bias. So, if we were trying to figure out how many friends the average person has, we have to think about all the people in the world, and how many friends they have.\nBefore we get into the application of this paradox let‚Äôs spend couple of minutes to understand what it means and why it‚Äôs true.\n\nBrief Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA, B, C, D are a part of social network. Let‚Äôs represent them as nodes, and draw edges connecting the nodes to indicate friendship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this graph, A is friends with B,C and D. As A is connected with all other B,C,D that‚Äôs why A is situated on center and establishing network with his all other friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere B is friend with A and C. Here, B is establishing network with both of his friend A and C. Actually, A and C is connected via B. They are not mutually connected with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, C is establishing network with both of his friend A and B. Actually, A and B is connected via C. They are not mutually connected with each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt last we can say that D is connected with A. There are four individuals, and they have a combined total 8 friends.\n\nSo on average, an individual has \\(\\dfrac{8}{4} = 2\\) friends\n\nNow, let‚Äôs take this one level deeper. A is a friend of 3 individuals, so we‚Äôll put his friends list below each of those instances.\n\n\n\n\n\nB is friend of 2 individuals, so we put his friends list below each of those instances. C is also a friend of 2 individuals, so we put her friends list below of those instances. And D is a friend of 1 individual, so we put his friends list below that instance. So, the 4 individuals have a combined total of 8 friends, who have a combined total of 18 friends.\n\nSo on average, an individual‚Äôs friend has \\(\\dfrac{18}{8} = 2.25\\) friends\n\n\n‚ÄúOn average an individual has fewer friends than his friends do‚Äù\n\nAnd it‚Äôs that way because the popular individuals are over represented in the latter calculation. In other words, popular A shows up in each of the others individual friendship networks and thus can make them all feel relatively deprived, while unpopular D shows up in only A‚Äôs friendship network and can only make A feel relatively advantaged. It‚Äôs form of sampling bias in which people with more friends are more likely to be an individual‚Äôs friend group and this bias may have important applications for studying the dynamical process of social network, like detecting an outbreaks.\n\n\nEarly Detection of Flu Outbreak\nThere are a lot of factors which affect one‚Äôs likelihood of contracting a virus. Some conditions are age, underlying health conditions, personal hygiene, airflow and ventilation conditions and positions within a social network. Individuals near the center of a social network are fewer steps away from the average individual in the network, so during the course of an outbreak, they are likely to be infected sooner than those at the periphery (all else being equal).\nNicholas Christakis, professor of medicine, medical sociology and sociology at Harvard University, and James Fowler, professor of medical genetics and political science at the University of California, San Diego, used the paradox to study the 2009 flu epidemic among 744 students. The findings, the researchers say, point to a novel method for early detection of contagious outbreaks.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed nodes correspond to infected individuals, yellow nodes correspond to friends of infected individuals, and node size is proportional to the number of friends infected. It‚Äôs subtle, but on average the red nodes are larger and in a greater concentration at the center of the network.\nBelow graph is the dummy version of previous picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when it comes to large networks, like a city or a country, it would be costly, time-consuming, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintrusive, to map out the entire social network in order to identify the centrally located individuals. And this is where the friendship paradox could come in handy."

    "text": "Detect and Control Infectious Diseases\nInfectious diseases are responsible for 32% death of worldwide with the biggest challenges in the poorest parts of the world. Inventing cheaper ways to detect and combat diseases especially in the most vulnerable areas is key. Infectious diseases are spread through contact between individuals via air particles or through direct physical contact.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we look at social networks like graphs we can see who‚Äôs in contact with whom. In practice we probably don‚Äôt know precisely who‚Äôs in touch with whom or where the edges are and joints of the graph lie but we may know about its probability distribution.\n\nProbability Distribution\nA probability distribution assigns a probability to a particular outcome. For example, when rolling a die each outcome has a probability of \\(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\) . These probability distributions also describe network.\n\n\nNetwork\nNetwork come in many different forms the simplest model is the erdos-renyi network where each possible edges is drawn with a fix probability.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we will vary the probability parameter and see how our graph changes\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever when modeling the spread of infection on such a network epidemiologists and social scientists noticed that this model didn‚Äôt describe real social networks other models such as the preferential attachment better show how disease is spread through social network.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model draws links depending on the existing number of links a point has just like how the rich become richer. We‚Äôre certain of vaccinations stop infectious diseases but if we can only afford to vaccinate a limited number of people or if a very infectious disease needs to be stopped quickly who should be targeted. Ideally we‚Äôd aim for the hub in the middle of the smaller networks as they have contact with the most people.\n\nBut how can we identify who these hubs are ?\n\nIf we randomly vaccinate people it‚Äôs highly unlikely that we‚Äôll be successful. The friendship paradox says that on average your friends have more friends than you do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause if we pick a random person and ask them to name a random person and ask them to name a friend they‚Äôre more likely to name someone who knows lots of people rather than someone who only knows 1 or 2 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that vaccinating a randomly selected contact of a randomly selected person will be more likely to hit the nub node and extinguish the epidemic. This is particularly true for preferential attachment like a social networks.\n\nThe friend group is better connected and likely to be connected and likely to be infected sooner, an effective immunization strategy might be to vaccinate the friend group first."

    "text": "Friendship Paradox in Facebook and Twitter\nThere is another form of outbreak which relates to the friendship paradox, things that go viral o the internet. And social media websites, like Facebook and Twitter, offer an ideal platform for studying the friendship paradox. They have huge global user bases and their connections are fully mapped out. In 2011, researchers studied the entire facebook social network and they found that 92.7% of users, on average, have fewer friends than their friends have.\n\nIn \\(2011\\), \\(721\\) MILLION USERS \\(68.7\\) BILLION FRIENDSHIP\n\nIf we look at twitter, twitter is a micro-blogging service on which users post short messages often accompanied by keywords marked by a hash to help them show up more easily in Twitter searches. Now unlike relations on facebook, Twitter relations are directional. When you follow someone, information flows in one direction. You get updates on their tweets, but not vice versa. You are the follower, they are the followee. In 2013, researchers studied a large portion of the global Twitter activity from 2009.\n\nDataset from \\(2009\\),\n\\(476\\) MILLION TWEETS\n\\(5.8\\) MILLION USERS\n\\(193\\) MILLION FOLLOWS\n\nand they found that 98% of uers were less popular than their followers and their followees. In 2014, other researchers used a different 2009 twitter dataset to explore hashtags going viral, a form of digital contagion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey compared randomly chosen individuals with a random selection of people they followed, to see whether trending twitter hashtags were used sooner by the followee groups. In this study they analyzed the performance of the 32 most widespread hashtags that appeared in their ample groups. And they found that, on average, members of the followee group, used the hashtags before the random group for all but 2 hashtags with average lead time of 7.1 days suggesting that by simply monitoring the activity of the followee group, you can detect viral outbreaks of the use of novel hashtags one week earlier than if you had monitored a random group. And even though this example is just of a digital outbreak on the internet, knowledge of the online activity of a group known to be central to a network, has the potential to provide early insights into real-world outbreaks."

One night, the infinite Hotel is completely full, totally booked up with an infinite number of guests.\n\n\n\n\n\nA man walks into the hotel and asks for a room. Rather than turn him down, the night manager decides to make room for him.\n\nHow?\n\n\n\n\n\nHe asks the guest in room number 1 to move to room number 2, the guest in room number 2 to move to room number 3, and so on.

The process can be repeated for any finite number of new guests.\n\nThere may not be a last room , but there‚Äôs always a next room.\n\n\n\nLet us Visualize:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rooms as a set ranging from 1 to an infinite number n.¬†There isn‚Äôt the last room, but there is always the next room.

Now, the infinitely large bus of infinite passengers perplexes the night manager at first, but he realizes there‚Äôs a way to place each new person.

    "text": "Story 3: An Infinite Number of Infinite Busses Arrives\nOne night, the unthinkable happens. The night manager looks outside and sees an infinite line of infinitely large buses, each with a countably infinite number of passengers.\n\nWhat Can he do?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf he can‚Äôt find the rooms for them, the hotel will lose out on an infinite amount of money, and he will surely lose his job. Luckily, he remembers that around the year 300 B.C.E., Euclid proved that there is an infinite quantity of prime.) numbers.\nSo to accomplish this seemingly impossible task of finding infinite beds for infinite buses of infinite weary travelers, the night manager assigns every current guest to the first prime number 2 raised to the power of their current room number.\n\nThe current occupant of room number 7 goes to room number which is room 128. The night manager then takes the people on the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their seat number on the bus. So, the person in seat number 7 on the first bus goes to room number or room number 2187.\n\nThis continues all of the first buses. The passenger on the second bus is assigned powers of the next prime, 5. The following bus, powers of 7. Each bus follows the power of 11, powers of 13, powers of 17, etc. Since each of these numbers only has 1 and the natural number powers of their prime number base as factors, there are no overlapping room numbers. All of the buses‚Äô passengers fan out into rooms using unique room assignment schemes based on unique prime numbers. In this way, the night manager can accommodate every passenger on every bus. Although, there will be many rooms that go unfilled, like room 6, since 6 is not a power of any prime number. Luckily, his bosses weren‚Äôt very good at mathematics, so his job is safe.\n\nThe night manager‚Äôs strategies are only possible because while the infinite hotel is certainly a logistical nightmare, it only deals with the lowest level of infinity, mainly, the countable infinity of the natural numbers, 1,2,3,4 and so on.\n\nGeorg Cantor) called this level ‚Äòinfinity aleph-zero.)‚Äô We use natural numbers for the room numbers as well as the seat numbers on the buses. If we are dealing with higher orders of infinity, such as that of the real numbers, these structured strategies would no longer be possible as we have no way to systematically include every number.\n\nThe real number infinite hotel has negative number rooms in the basement, fractional rooms, so the guy in room ¬Ω always suspects he has less room than the guy in room 1. Square root rooms, like room radical 2, and room œÄ, where the guests expect free desert.\n\n\n\nWhat self-respecting night manager would ever want to work there even for an infinite salary?\nAt Hilbert‚Äôs infinite hotel, where there‚Äôs never any vacancy and always room for more, the scenarios faced by the ever-diligent and may be too hospitable night manager serves to remind us of just hard it is for our relatively finite minds to grasp a concept of as larger as infinity. Maybe you can help tackle these problems after a good night‚Äôs sleep. But honestly, we might need someone to change rooms at 2 am."

For example, 30 can be written as \\(30=3 \\times2 \\times5\\) . So, we have two types of numbers primes and composite numbers. Euclid‚Äôs theorem is fairly straightforward. It states that\n\n‚ÄúThere are an infinite number of primes.‚Äù\n\nLet‚Äôs quickly go over a proof. This proof is actually pretty interesting. We have used proof by contradiction. We have assumed that this statement is false i.e., there are finite number of primes.\n\nLet P be the product of every single prime number.\nLet Q = P + 1\na) If Q is prime, then contradiction.\nb) If Q isn‚Äôt prime then one of its prime factors p\n\nLet‚Äôs look at one of those prime factors \\(p\\) and since \\(p\\) also divides \\(P\\), it should divides \\(P-Q\\) which is equal to \\(1\\) and since no prime number divides \\(1\\), it‚Äôs another contradiction. So it‚Äôs proved that ‚Äòthere are infinite number of prime‚Äô."

    "text": "Series\nA series can be highly generalized as the sum of all the terms in a sequence. However, there has to be a definite relationship between all the terms of the sequence. If think a bit deeper it‚Äôs actually cumulative sum of a given sequence of the terms. It‚Äôs obvious a series can be finite or infinite.\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}\\;\\; \\text{is a finite series}\\] \\[\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} r^n = 1+r+r^2+r^3+\\ldots+r^n+ \\ldots \\;\\; \\text{is an infinite series}\\]\nNow let‚Äôs talk about harmonic series which we write as, \\[\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{n} = 1+\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{1}{3}+\\dfrac{1}{4}+ \\ldots\\]This series was shown divergent in \\(14^{\\text{th}}\\) century. It means that it does not approach to a finite value. It just goes on to infinity. A harmonic series is a \\(p\\text{-series}\\) which is a more general term. The general term of a \\(p\\text{-series}\\) is as follows,\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\dfrac{1}{n^{p}} = 1+\\dfrac{1}{2^p}+\\dfrac{1}{3^p}+\\dfrac{1}{4^p}+ \\ldots\n\\]\nThe p-series will always converge when \\(p&gt;1\\) . So converge means it approach to a finite value. Now we‚Äôll define something call the zeta function which is written as follows,\n\\[\n\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{n^s}\n\\]\nEssentially, the zeta function gives the \\(p\\text{-series}\\) given a value of \\(p\\). But how does this have anything to do with prime numbers? that‚Äôs why we talked about Euler‚Äôs product formula. Instead of just only giving the formula, I want to discuss the idea. So, let‚Äôs just start off with this zeta function.\n\\(\\displaystyle \\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\dfrac{1}{n^s} = 1+\\dfrac{1}{2^s}+\\dfrac{1}{3^s}+\\dfrac{1}{4^s}+\\ldots \\hspace{3cm} (1)\\)\n\\(\\implies \\ \\dfrac {1}{2^s}\\zeta(s) = \\dfrac{1}{2^s}+\\dfrac{1}{4^s}+\\dfrac{1}{6^s}+\\dfrac {1}{8^s}+\\ldots \\; \\; \\text{[multiplying both sides by the second term of the sequence]} \\hspace{2.5cm} (2)\\)\nSo you can see the right side every single multiple of 2 in the denominator. So if we want to remove that from the original zeta function. So, next step we just subtract equation 2 from equation 1\n\\(\\implies \\left( 1-\\dfrac{1}{2^s} \\right) \\zeta(s) = 1+\\dfrac{1}{3^s}+\\dfrac{1}{5^s}+\\dfrac{1}{7^s}+\\dfrac{1}{9^s}+\\ldots \\hspace{3cm} (3)\\)\nThen we‚Äôre going to repeat same process. So we‚Äôre gonna multiply both sides by the second term of the series now which is \\(\\dfrac{1}{3^s}\\) if we do so we‚Äôll have,\n\\(\\implies \\dfrac{1}{3^s}\\left( 1-\\dfrac{1}{2^s} \\right)\\zeta(s) = \\dfrac{1}{3^s}+\\dfrac{1}{9^s}+\\dfrac{1}{15^s}+\\dfrac{1}{21^s}+ \\dfrac{1}{27^s}+\\ldots \\hspace{3cm} (4)\\)\nand we have these terms and then we subtract them from the equation 3 then we‚Äôll have,\n\\(\\implies \\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{3^s} \\right) \\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{2^s} \\right)\\zeta(s) = 1+\\dfrac{1}{5^s}+\\dfrac{1}{7^s}+\\dfrac{1}{11^s}+\\dfrac{1}{11^s}+ \\dfrac{1}{13^s}+\\ldots\\hspace{3cm} (5)\\)\nSo, we do this process again and again you‚Äôll see that every time we do this we are subtracting multiples of each number so the second term in our sequence is always going to prime and if we continue this process to infinity we will get something like this.\n\\[\n\\ldots \\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{11^s} \\right) \\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{7^s} \\right) \\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{5^s} \\right) \\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{3^s} \\right) \\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{2^s} \\right)\\zeta(s) = 1\n\\]\nand if we move all the primes to the other side writing this formula we will have,\n\\[\\sum_{\\\nn\\in\\mathbb{N}\n} \\dfrac{1}{n^s} = \\prod_{p\\; \\text{prime}} \\frac {1} {1-p^{-s}} \\] This is called the Euler‚Äôs product formula it gives us the first relation between zeta function and prime numbers and since this formula was discovered in 1737, modern study of prime numbers always based on the zeta function."

If the Riemann hypothesis is true this error is no more than some function of order \\(\\sqrt{x}\\ \\ln(x)\\) and this goes both ways if you can prove that the error is a function of order \\(\\sqrt{x}\\ \\ln(x)\\) the Riemann hypothesis is true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more direct question is how is the Riemann hypothesis and primes related?\n\n\\[\n\\pi(x) = \\text{li}(x) - \\sum_\\rho \\text{li}(x^\\rho)-\\log(2)+\\int_{x}^\\infty \\dfrac{dt}{t(t^2-1)\\log(t)}\n\\]\nSo, this would be where we discuss about Riemann explicit formula. Riemann explicit formula gives us a direct formula for the prime counting function and the second term over here i.e., \\(\\displaystyle \\sum_\\rho \\text{li}(x^\\rho)\\) is a sum of all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann-zeta function. There is a visualization attached below.\n\n\n\nRiemann‚Äôs explicit formula using the first 200 non-trivial zeros of the zeta function\n\n\nHere the graph is about Riemann‚Äôs explicit formula using the first 200 non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. And you can see how the graph becomes better and better approximation. Using non trivial zeros of the Riemann-zeta function you can approximate prime counting function to have a pretty high accuracy."

If the scattered energy is analyzed utilizing a spectrometer, the bulk of the energy is found at the frequency of the incident beam ùúà but a small portion of the scattered energy will be found at frequencies \\(\\nu=\\nu_{0}\\pm \\nu_m\\). The scattering of radiation with a change of frequency is called Raman scattering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Raman Scattering?\nIn Raman spectroscopy, by varying the frequency of the radiation, a spectrum can be produced, showing the intensity of the exiting radiation for each frequency. This spectrum will show which frequencies of radiation have been absorbed by the molecule to raise it to higher vibrational energy states.¬†\n\n\nRayleigh Scattering and Raman Scattering\nScattering of electromagnetic radiation is in two common types Rayleigh and Raman scattering. Even though there are some differences between them, the key difference between Rayleigh and Raman scattering is that Rayleigh scattering is a form of elastic scattering of light or any other electromagnetic radiation whereas Raman scattering is a form of inelastic scattering of light or any other electromagnetic radiation.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency of the scattered light can be:\n\nAt the original frequency \\((\\nu_0)\\)‚ÄúRayleigh scattering‚Äù.\nAt some shifted frequency \\((\\nu_{s}=\\nu_0 \\pm \\nu_{\\text{molecule}})\\) ‚ÄúRaman scattering or Raman Effect."

But do we really become so after ages? Do we really know what or why it is called ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù? Ideally, a situation or system is termed perfect when each component is acted upon in order, either sequentially or systematically. In our society, perfection is often looked upon as an ultimatum. But from a broader perspective, this is not the case. According to Stephen Hawking‚Äî‚ÄúOne of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect. Perfection simply doesn‚Äôt exist... Without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist.‚Äù\nPerfection readily breaks down in the presence of minute disorder or disturbance, which is ubiquitous in any system. So, nobody can be perfect in absolute terms. From this point on, things get complicated and tend toward disorder. More specifically, the second law of thermodynamics states that ‚Äúas one goes forward in time, the net entropy (degree of disorder) of any isolated or closed system will always increase (or at least stay the same).‚Äù Basically, entropy is a measure of the disorder of the universe on both macro and microscopic levels, an important mental model as it applies to every part of our lives. Contemplating entropy will fundamentally change our perspective on the world."

The same mechanism is followed when coffee cools down and the heat from coffee flows into the room, naturally and spontaneously.

    "text": "The Connection between Time and Entropy\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the few concepts that validate the existence of time is entropy. Entropy always decreases as we move forward in time. We experience a single direction, or ‚ÄúArrow of Time‚Äù, from the past to the future. From this point, a question arises‚Äîcan we change the course of events? Most scientists will tell you no. Causal determinism forbids it. Time loops have a significant impact on the principle of causality on the relationship between cause and effect. Therefore, everything is mutually dependent. The past does not just influence the future, the future also influences the past. It is just like the question of the chicken and the egg. We can no longer say which of the two came first. Everything is connected to everything else.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a switch point at the junction in the loop of time. The moment that allows things to run in one direction or the other. You do something, or you don‚Äôt. A line that meets itself again in the loop creates two possible paths: along the outer edge of the line or along the inner edge of the line. And yet it is the same line. Two overlapping realities. On one of these paths, you are a painter, on the other, you are a singer. Both possibilities recur in the loop, again and again, one triggering the other. Scientists call it Quantum Entanglement.\nIt is human nature to believe that we play a role in our own lives and destiny. Everyone should adhere to it. As Brian Cox said, ‚ÄúThe Arrow of Time dictates that as each moment passes, things change, and once these changes have happened, they are never undone. Permanent change is a fundamental part of what it means to be human. We all age as the years pass by‚Äîpeople are born, they live, and they die. It‚Äôs part of the joy and tragedy of our lives, but out there in the universe, those grand and epic cycles appear eternal and unchanging. But that‚Äôs an illusion. In the life of the universe, just as in our lives, everything is irreversibly changing.‚Äù"

Mankind has always been puzzled over its origin and its genesis. Are we created by God or a product of evolution?

Einstein however had just realized the time stretches and contracts varying with velocity. Due to its malleability time like space deserved its own dimension in fact Einstein claimed that the two were one and the same together they formed a four dimensional fabric or continuum called space-time upon which the mundane events of the universe would unfold.\n\n\n\n\n\nEinstein suggested that massive objects like the Sun didn‚Äôt pull bodies like earth with mysterious Inexplicable tug, but rather curved the fabric of space-time around them. Forcing earth to fall down into this steep valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitive Explanation\nA highly simplified analogy is the dip in a trampoline made by a falling bowling ball. If a marble were placed on that trampoline the marble would immediately roll towards the bowling ball in the center. This is also true for the Earth‚Äôs gravity. We‚Äôre pinned to the ground because space so distorted by the Earth‚Äôs mass pushes us down from above. However, the slump in the fabric around Earth is not uniform and Earth‚Äôs gravity grows more intense as we move towards its center where the curvature is at a maximum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore like the marble on the trampoline an object that falls towards the earth accelerates as it races towards the center of the planet. It falls faster when just above the surface than it does say when it is slightly above the atmosphere. But according to special relativity the faster you move through space the slower you move through time. This means that time runs slower on Earth‚Äôs surface then it does above the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent planets have different masses and the different gravitational strength. They also accelerate objects at different rates as he have learnt this means a variable passage of time.\nThis what happened in the movie ‚ÄòInterstellar‚Äô when the protagonist land on a planet in the proximity of a black hole.\n\nThe gravity on the planet is so server that one hour of the surface is equivalent to seven years on the Earth.\n\n\n\nTimekeeping Mechanism\nTo understand how motion effects time let‚Äôs considered the simplest timekeeping mechanism. A second passes each time the photon is reflected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs imagine two people one in a spaceship slightly above Earth‚Äôs atmosphere and the second on top of a small hill just above the Earth‚Äôs surface. Both are watching a man fall from space towards the ground.\nLet‚Äôs say that the falling man is carrying the photon clock\n\nWhat to each of the two man observe as the man falls pass them ?\nWhat they observe is eerily similar to what a stationary person would observe when watching a ball bounce in a moving train ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the man falls from the space, the light in his clock would appear to move in triangles to the observers.This would mean that light travels a longer distance consequently stretching the duration of a second. It‚Äôs obvious that the length of triangles the light traces and therefore the duration of a second is proportional to the velocity of the falling man.\nWhen we recall that objects closer to the center of the planet fall faster . We can determine the time would appear to pass slower to the man on the hill than it does to the man in the spaceship above. Of course the difference is infinitesimal. The difference between the time measured by clocks at the tops of mountains and at the surface of Earth is a matter of nano seconds.Time dilation affects every clock whether it relies on basic electromagnetism or a complex combination of electromagnetism and Newton‚Äôs laws of motion. In fact even biological processes are slowed down.\nYes, that‚Äôs right your head is slightly older than your feet."

So, how do three envelopes set up a paradox?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1961, logician and philosopher Willard Van Orman Quineoutlined the three categories of paradoxes. Let‚Äôs consider that I have them each hidden inside these three envelopes. One represents the kind of paradox that you‚Äôre most familiar with. Those that defy logic are like the Impossible Waterfall. The Waterfall painted by Maurits Cornelis Escher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, What if I open the envelope which is red and it comes ‚ÄúFalsidical‚Äù?This is why Achilles can never catch a tortoise.\nSee What the Tortoise Said to Achilles.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuming that, if the tortoise gets a 100-meter head start, then Achilles starts running, by the time he gets to the 100-meter mark, the tortoise will have moved another meter. It takes Achilles some more time to get to that 101-meter mark and in that time, the tortoise has moved forward even further.\n\n\n\n\n\nAchilles will always be catching up to the place the tortoise was as the tortoise inches forward. The gap will get smaller, but the tortoise is always slightly ahead. According to Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea, who dreamed up¬†this paradox 2500 years ago, the fastest runner in the world can never overtake a tortoise in a race because you infinitely divide the distance between them as the tortoise advances. But that‚Äôs ridiculous. We know it‚Äôs not true. Even with the head start, you could outrun a tortoise and you aren‚Äôt Achilles. So how can this be a paradox?"

    "text": "Can Mathematics Conquer Achilles?\nZeno knew Achilles could catch up to the tortoise in real life, but couldn‚Äôt prove it mathematically. He thought there would be an infinite number of new points for the tortoise to reach that Achilles had to reach because he didn‚Äôt know that an infinite series of numbers could add up to a finite value. No one knew that for another 2000 years. Now we call a convergent series,\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{1}{4}+\\dfrac{1}{8}+\\dfrac{1}{16}+...\\infty=1\\)\nThis infinite series goes on forever, but it eventually adds up to 1. And at that 1 is where, mathematically, Achilles finally reaches the tortoise. We knew that Achilles could catch up to the tortoise, but it took inventing calculus for us to prove why. This is why this paradox that confounded great minds for thousands of years is falsidical. Described by Willard Van Orman Quine like this,\n\nA falsidical paradox packs a surprise, but it is seen as a false alarm when we solve the underlying fallacy\n\nSo, one paradox envelope down, and two go to go. Again, assume that behind the envelope white we have: Veridical. To understand this if we conduct a game show like this if we replace the two envelopes you‚Äôve already opened with some prizes. How about we put a million dollars into one of them and Sherlock Holmes (Sherlock Holmes is a fictional detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle) in the other? The third and brown envelope still contains the term for the final type of paradox. There is a second person who is hosting the game show he/she writes 1,2,3 according to his/her preference, host shuffles these up and he/she asks you to choose the correct one and you‚Äôll win the grand prize. After you make your selection (without switching the envelope), let‚Äôs say envelope X. The game show host reveals what‚Äôs inside one of the two remaining envelopes. It‚Äôs Sherlock Holmes. Now there are only two envelopes left: The one that you‚Äôve chosen and the remaining mystery envelope. He gives you the option to switch your envelope."

The odds of winning with your first chosen envelope are 1/3. So, you have a 33.33% repeating chance of being right and a 66.66% repeating chance of being wrong. When the game show host revealed the Sherlock, it didn‚Äôt suddenly improve your odds to 50/50. The proof is in the options. After first choosing an envelope, the thing revealed by the host will never be the money because that would ruin the tension of the game show. So, if your initial 1 out of 3 picks wasn‚Äôt the money and the money is Y, then the host will reveal Z. If you chose wrong and the money is Z, then the host reveals Y. If you luckily chose the money the first time, then the host can reveal either Z or Y. It doesn‚Äôt matter. No matter what you‚Äôre still stuck in that initial 33% chance that you chose right the very first time. If you switch, regardless of the prize revealed, you now leap into the 66% zone. You‚Äôve doubled your chances of getting the money.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo put it another way, when you are asked if you want to switch, you‚Äôre actually being given a dilemma: Do you want to keep your single envelope, or do you want both of the other two? It just so happens that you already know what‚Äôs inside one of them. But since the one revealed will never contain the money, the chances that the other unopened envelope has the money are twice as high as the first one that you chose.\nThe Monty Hall Problem blew up after a 1990 Parade magazinecolumnist advocated switching doors in this same scenario from the game show ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make a deal‚Äù. When she told readers they should always switch to improve their odds of winning nearly about 1,000 people with PhDs wrote in to tell her that she was wrong. They were. So, the ‚ÄòMonty Hall Paradox‚Äô is like the Potato Paradoxis an example of one that is a ‚ÄòVeridical Paradox‚Äô, one that initially seems wrong, but is proven to be true.\n\nA veridical paradox packs surprise, but the surprise quickly dissipates itself as we ponder the proof.\n‚Äî Willard Van Orman Quine\n\nThere are paradoxes that seem absurd but have a perfectly good explanation, and ones that seem false and actually are false because of an underlying fallacy even if it takes a major advance in mathematics to prove it.\nThe remaining last envelope, the 3rd envelope contains the kind you think of when you think of paradoxes i.e., Antinomy. The Grandfather Paradox is where you go back in time to kill your grandfather when he was a child but that means your father was never born so you weren‚Äôt born. So, how could you go back in time to kill your grandfather? It‚Äôs ridiculous. MinutePhysicsproposed a solution to this but these types of paradoxes are not true or false. Actually, they can‚Äôt be true and they can‚Äôt be false. As Willard Van Orman Quine put it, they create a crisis ‚ÄúCrisis in thought‚Äù."

    "text": "I am Lying\nIf I‚Äôm lying when I say that, then I must actually be telling the truth. But how can I be telling if I‚Äôm lying? The Liar Paradox is an example of Antinomy which literally means ‚ÄòAgainst law‚Äô & highlights a serious logical incompatibility.\n\nAn antinomy packs a surprise that can be accommodate by nothing less than a repudiation of part of our conceptual heritage. ‚Äî Willard Van Orman Quine\n\nAntinomies are paradoxes to us all. Falsidical and veridical paradoxes are only paradoxes to those who don‚Äôt know the solution, but they are still of value. Every time we resolve a scenario that runs counter to our or someone else‚Äôs initial expectations, every time we learn the how and why and share that information. We‚Äôre refining and clarifying knowledge. Which makes all three types of paradoxes excellent tools for reasoning. Whether or not something is paradoxical to an individual depends on the accuracy of their expectations. Today, modern mathematics has given us the ability to show that Zeno‚Äôs paradoxes are falsidical. But they were pure antinomy, unresolved to everyone for millennia.\n\nOne man‚Äôs antinomy is another man‚Äôs falsidical paradox, give or take a couple of thousand years.\n‚Äî Willard Van Orman Quine\n\nWho knows which antinomies of today will be solved in the future? Right now we are struggling with the paradox of the Faint Young Sun: our current knowledge of stars says that billions of years ago, our sun wasn‚Äôt hot enough to keep the Earth from being a ball of ice. But our geological evidence shows an ancient Earth with liquid oceans and budding life when everything should have been frozen. How could the Earth have liquid water without a sun hot enough to melt ice? It‚Äôs antinomy until we fully comprehend the situation. Maybe our current understanding of the sun isn‚Äôt perfect or maybe our knowledge of early Earth is missing some pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\nA paradox is a problem where the solution is, or made to seem, impossible. Sometimes they‚Äôre purposely designed for fun because our minds like puzzles. Sometimes we just stumble on a gap between what we know and how we talk about what we know, and what is actually true. When we solve an impossible antinomy, it becomes falsidical or veridical. Someone who knows the answer can see what the problem was all along: We tricked ourselves by knowing too little or by asking the wrong question. In one way or another, all paradoxes come from people. By challenging us to find the flaw or fill the gap in our knowledge, paradoxes help us to define and push our intellectual boundaries. There‚Äôs always for us to know. Whether we know it or not."

We do not get the motivation for it. Due to a lack of motivation, we lose patience, and interest to understand what is probability & why it exists. I believe that this domain of mathematics which we will be discussing furthermore is realistic and abstract. Before going to deep dive into any kind of mathematics, theorem, or principle one must understand what is the idea, and motivation behind constructing such an operation which is abstract but realistic and most important thing is if we do not get the motivation about this, we will not be able to understand any kind of mathematics behind it, we will be puzzled and the study which we will incorporate it will be meaningless."

    "text": "Motivation and the Achievement in Probability\nTo understand what we are trying to achieve, and what we are trying to conclude, it is necessary to get introduced to two important words. One has to be clear when he/she is going to use these two words frequently in probabilistic phenomena i.e.¬†Deterministic and Indeterministic.\nDeterministic: The word deterministic refers, to a belief that everything that happens must happen as it does and could not have happened any other way. Now, if we say that when a methodology is deterministic it refers that the chance of occurrence of the event involved is ignored and the method used is considered to follow a definite rule. If we make more simplification, deterministic addresses the situation which will take place is already predetermined.\nIndeterministic: The word indeterministic refers to the idea that events are not caused deterministically. It is the idea that the will is a free and deliberate choice and actions are not determined by or predictable from antecedent causes.\nIn our mathematical science, there are two types of experiments ‚Äî 1) Random Experiment, and 2) Deterministic Experiment."

    "text": "Deterministic vs Random Experiment\nRandom Experiment:\n\nAn experiment is random if it is repeated numerous times under the same conditions.\nThe outcome of an individual random experiment must be I.I.D. (independent & identically distributed)\nBefore we carry it out, we cannot predict its outcome.\nIt can be repeated as many times as we want always under the same conditions.\n\n\nThat means in the case of a random experiment, we know the possible outcomes, but in a particular occurrence, which outcome is going to occur that we cannot predict.\n\nExample:\n\nPercentage of call dropped due to errors over a particular time period. The experiment can yield several different outcomes in the region 0‚àí100%\nThe time difference between two messages arriving at a message centre. This experiment can yield any number of possible outcomes.\nThe time difference between two different voice calls over a particular network. This too can yield any number of possible outcomes.\n\nDeterministic Experiment:\nIn a deterministic experiment, the result might be anticipated with assurance in advance, such as the addition of two numbers 5 and 6 or we can say these experiments give the same outcome under identical conditions.\n\nDetermining your savings account amount after a month (including your principal amount and the interest amount).\nThe relationship between a boundary and radius of a circle, or the area and radius of a circle.\n\n\nThat means the set of all possible outcomes is completely determined before carrying it out.\n\nWhen we learn probability, our goal is to understand the pattern in Chaos. Generally, we deal with indeterminist aspects. So, when we will be dealing with an indeterministic sequence like a random sequence which we do not know, how it behaves but we have a deterministic sequence, we know how it behaves. So if the things which are indeterministic become very close to a deterministic thing that would suggest a pattern rather than a deterministic pattern in the indeterministic sequence. If an indeterministic sequence /stochastic sequence is becoming infinitesimally close to a deterministic/non-stochastic sequence then it suggests that the indeterministic sequence eventually shows a consistent pattern. Which is a big achievement while dealing with things that are indeterministic or unpredictable. In probability & statistics, our interest in the study is ‚Äòwhat is indeterministic‚Äô, what cannot be determined.\nThe main motive of probability i.e.¬†to make a thorough study on the indeterministic things which are not obvious.\nWe are trying to achieve or learn how to predict things in indeterministic situations i.e., how to predict things where we cannot determine something completely. We often heard the term Random Variable.\nA random variable is an indeterministic thing we do not know how it will behave when.¬†A sequence of random variables is an indeterministic thing, we do not know how it will behave, where it will converge, and whether it will converge or not. We do not know anything about that. But a sequence of constants is deterministic. We know how it will behave.¬†We know how it will go, and where its clusters. If we can show that the indeterministic random sequence behaves like a deterministic sequence or it becomes very close to a deterministic sequence or a thing that can‚Äôt be determined. So, that implies the indeterministic sequence will show a pattern like a deterministic sequence and that‚Äôs the achievement. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much less or more it is. It‚Äôs a significant achievement i.e., out of indeterministic things, out of random things, out of stochastic things, we‚Äôre at least achieving a pattern. So that is the most important thing which matters.\nSo the idea is simple, i.e., how we are trying to make a deterministic conclusion about an indeterministic sequence.\nThis is a justified explanation that we actually do in the discipline of Probability and Statistics. This idea is important to understand the motivation of probability.\n\nReferences:\n\nIntroduction to Probability Book by Jessica Hwang and Joseph K.
